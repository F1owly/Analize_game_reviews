"I have never played a game this good. This was the first souls game I played, and this has successfully made me fall in love with the genre. I cannot make any comments on the graphics because I was playing on a lower-end television, but I can comment on the boss design. Most of the bosses are incredible. Just incredibly well made fights, with the exception of a few, like Regal Ancestral Spirit. RAS was just simply not made for melee, which is the play style I always take up. I haven't ever completely a magic-only run, but from what I have heard magic is extremely fun to play. I just simply prefer the difficulty that comes with melee. Melee combat feels really, really good, although it does not flow as well as Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. The majority of the weapons in the game are extremely well made and have some purpose. Bows and crossbows are pretty much entirely pointless, though. I have pretty much no complaints with the game, other than it not being cross-platform. I think if the game was cross-platform I'd only enjoy it more. I suppose the game could also benefit from Seamless Co-op being a vanilla feature, but other than that the game is flawless.",1.0

"What can I say from Elden ring. This has been definitely the game that has challenged me the most but also the game that once I finished made me feel proud. On series X looks amazing, 10/10 in graphics,Lore 8/10 (because a lot of stuff is not told, you need to be reading descriptions or investigating by yourself), enemies 10/10 (f*** Malenia),movement 9/10, combat 10/10. Simply this game is amazing. Thanks FromSoftware!!!!!",0.8999999999999999
"This game is so terrible that I can honestly say I didn't enjoy a single moment of it. Total waste of money!

Then you realize you've wasted money on this giant pile of crap.",0.0

"This dark souls-like and open-world adventure continues to mock the player in symbolism and difficulty. The experience is rewarding with detailed, immersive, and atmospheric aesthetics while punishing with little guidance for direction and strategy. Navigation is scenic and relaxing, however, traversal is sometimes difficult and frustrating. A companion guide wiki may seem desired for completion and during moments of uncertainty. Multiplayer is flexible, aiming for a choice-driven interaction whether it is pvp or co-op. Overall, it is a great game with demanding skill requirements.",0.8

"I love souls games.  I have played and finished almost all of them, especially the Bloodborne and Dark Souls series many times.  But none of the final bosses were like this.  All we can do is run away, run away, run away, this does not make the player feel like he is playing a game, or does not give the taste of that great final boss fight.  It's no fun just running away and not hitting. This is the first time you've been disgusted with the end of a Souls game.  Miyazaki, there was no need to spoil such a wonderful series to satisfy your own ego.  I don't always want to run away, I also want to hit or kill sometimes.  Worst final boss you've ever done.",0.0
"Essa DLC, ouso dizer, que é ainda melhor que o jogo base. Obviamente sem toda a história e experiência que eu já tive no jogo base ela não seria tão boa, porém o tamanho do mapa ajuda muito na vontade de explorá-lo e faz com que literalmente todos os cantos você encontre algo novo.

One of the best games of all time. I loved every second of it and it deserved game of the year. Brilliant boss ideas and great execution. The best feeling when you beat something that you have been on for hours. Great that you can play it in 30 different ways! Brilliant idea and just a great execution. The only thing I will say is that it did become hard to explore when unlocking all of the map.,0.8999999999999999

"I enjoyed a lot of Sekiro's gameplay, Bloodborne's ambiance and story, and DS3's overall vibe as a game. I had Elden Ring on my wishlist for almost two years, and when I finally got it, I was **** combat in Elden Ring quickly becomes monotonous. Once you acquire a good weapon, which requires some initial effort, you tend to stick with it for the rest of the game. This is because there are only a few truly effective weapons, and upgrading a weapon is such an investment that farming materials to level up another one feels **** game features a wide variety of enemies, but unfortunately, about 70% of them share the same moveset and slow behavior, making them easy to defeat in 2-3 hits. The most interesting enemies are the faster and more aggressive ones, but even they become repetitive after the first **** story is almost non-existent unless you delve into secondary quests, which often feel like you're just running errands.I wish this game were as engaging as Sekiro, Bloodborne, or Dark Souls 3. Those games reward exploration and provide a sense of progression through gameplay, rather than relying solely on character stats.",0.4
"I have played Elden Ring for hundreds of hours. There will probably never ever be any other game which will come even close to this time investment. My first character, who is now in NG+2, has now about 300 hours on the clock and I am still enjoying playing this game a lot. So why, you might think, do I give this game only an average score? Other than probably many other players who started with Elden Ring as their first Soulslike game and who gave the game a higher score? I played all the original Souls games and I would like to rate the game as an evolution of the Souls genre that has been created by Fromsoft and which originated with Demon's Souls (2009) and which became popular with the widely acclaimed Dark Souls series (2011-2016). Elden Ring follows these footsteps and brings in new ideas, most importantly presents a coherent and massive open world. So for the first time a Soulslike game has this kind of setting and I generally like it that Fromsoft always try out new things with their brand instead of iterating the same type of game over and over again. However: the experiment failed this time. The open world in Elden Ring has just the same problems as many other action RPG's have that do not jail the player in combat encounters. Namely, the player can always run away and fight normal enemies or even bosses from a distance. While you would not do this most of the time, because it doesn't make much fun to play the game like this, the simple fact that this always is an option to the player removes any of the engaging atmospheres of the Dark Souls games where the environments are always spatially confined areas with a logical and challenging enemy placement combined sometimes with tricky platforming sections. All this is not well represented anymore in Elden Ring and I even have difficulties to see the game as a Soulslike game due to this when comparing it to other recent Soulslike games from other developers (Lies of P, Neowiz and Round8 (2023) and Lords of the Fallen, Hexworks (2023)). I can not list all the flaws of Elden Ring due to the openworld setting here, yet one aspect of it is very annoying and immersion breaking. Namely there are many field bosses who can despawn when you fought them on the edge of their spawn area. That is, enemies can not follow you across the whole map, but will eventually disappear in the middle (!) of the combat (!!) and you have to run back to their original spawning location to continue the fight. These are the situations where you notice: ah, yes, this is just a computer game made by bad programmers who do not understand (yet) how to build an open world with engaging enemy encounters. While this may sound harsh towards Fromsoft who made some of my most favourite games of all times, I think it is important that we, the players and fans of their games do not only see the good but also point to the bad design choices in their games. I also do not think that the Soulslike genre does not work well per se with an open world setting. But the above mentioned problems need to be addressed and maybe Fromsoft should take a look at other open world games in order to see how they can improve on their current iteration of the Soulslike games. To name but a few open world games: GTA5 or RDR2 by Rockstar Games are probably the best open world games ever made. They are not the same genre, of course, but what I mean here is, for example, that a police car that chases you in GTA5 will literally follow you across the whole map. The Rockstar open world games have no limits, no borders that restrict certain interactions. Another example I would like mention is Dragon's Dogma 2 (Capcom, 2024). Here the open world is in many areas segmented by spatial restrictions, like narrow valleys, rivers, buildings, caves, etc. Unlike Elden Ring's map, which has wide space areas most of the time. And this is a crucial distinction of the design of the map of both games. In fact, the environment with enemy encounters in DD2 are much more close to what one is used to in the classical Souls games which are non open world. In a nutshell: Elden Ring did not revolutionise open world games (as I have read in another review) but the developers still need to learn a lot on how to make a good open world game that supports the atmosphere and gameplay of a Souls game. Elden Ring was their first attempt on this, but it did not work out very well.",0.5

"This is a good game and could be a great game if they fixed the multiplayer. Currently, if you are playing co-op, you will get invaded by a griefer. I would prefer a 5 minute unskippable ad for hemorrhoid cream. The griefers aren't particularly difficult, even with starting gear, but they interrupt the flow of the game.

"I love the scale of the game and how the game ramps up in scale as you play the game. You start in an area that seems like a pretty big map already, then you start discovering more and more and add to that map that you originally thought was big until the area that you started in looks pretty much molecular compared to everywhere else that you’ve been. The areas are amazingly well crafted and are filled to the brim with things to do and items to collect, the story is interesting and easy to follow on the surface but becomes a satisfying tangled web as you start to dig deeper that only adds to the immersion of the game. Overall, the game is a masterpiece, but it isn’t my masterpiece. I’ll be the first to admit that I am bad at this game and actually have yet to finish it, I do love the story and everything that surrounds the game but I cannot for the life of me just sit down and complete the game. I am decently far into it and I know how the game ends but I am just unable to sit down and complete despite my love for the game.",0.8

"Elden Ring is an excellent game (GOTY 2022) and possibly the best soulslike ever created. What i really liked after 150 hours of playing and the platinum trophy is that this game wants and succeds on treating you like a clever person and not a dumb braindead gamer who only needs 2 buttons to play a game or watch 30 hours of cinematics or depend on QTEs in combat all the time. The game demands intelligence and imagination from you, from exploration to customization and from skill and technique to fast reflexes. I mean, Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne already had these things but now they are even better. The ONLY 2 reasons that hold it back from true greatness imo (9/10 and not 10/10) are, first, the story is almost non-existent and second, the technical side in general, both in terms of graphics and music/sounds/ost, could be better. I mean, i played Hogwarts Legacy and then came back immediately to play again Elden Ring and it seemed to me like a game from 2015 or something. Nevertheless, a true must-buy for every soulslike lover or action rpg gamer in general.",1.0
"While I think the game is fantastic in it's own area of gaming, It just doesn't compare to other games that are rated this highly. This game winning GOTY over God Of War Ragnorok was criminal, But then Dark Souls III losing to Overwatch was also criminal so I guess it balances itself out. While most of the game feels incredibly well designed and absolutely beautifully, some bosses and areas feel cheap and janky so this game is far from the 10/10 most people give it. Hope this helps",0.8

Possibly the best game ever made. A very strong gameplay loop and great story. There is a whole lot of brilliant side content in a huge and beautiful world. It is very difficult and filled with brilliant content. I have played many of fromsoft's previous masterpieces and can confidently say that it is the best. The few gripes that I a have are just that there is no boss rush mode or good duo boss. I have no doubt in my mind that the is issues will be fixed in the upcoming DLC. This game is as close as any game has ever gotten and it well deserved game of the year in 2022.,1.0
"I am confident in saying that Elden Ring is one of the greatest souls of all time. I have played from the first soul, ""Demon Souls,"" to ""Sekiro,"" the last one. But Elden Ring had changed all points of view about soul games. The Open World, mixed with classic souls, is a huge success. As soon as you start playing, you feel the soul's atmosphere, but in a huge and fascinating open world. And you don't know where to go. Elden Ring is better than previous games in all things: new game mechanics, hardest boss battles, well-made design maps, new weapons and magic setups, epic music, fantastic art design, and multiple endings. I strongly recommend both newcomers and veteran players. Final score 10/10",1.0

"This is easily the worst From Soft game ever made. Played through this game entirely feeling as though it was the end of From Software making good games.

"After 156 hours I completed Elden Ring along with about 95% of the character side quests and all optional and main bosses. This game has one of the best worlds to explore I've ever seen in any game I have played; the visuals are spectacular and not one single inch feels wasted. One of my favorite things about this game is every weapon and spell looks cool but also feel viable to the point you can pretty much make any build you want. This game is the peak of From Software's design in Dark Souls in giving freedom to the players to play however they want. The fluid combat and the added ability to jump add to the great experience of fighting and exploring in this game. The games story like other soul's games is very obscure but also very rich if you are willing to look for it. The characters are mostly good, but I felt they could have done more with certain ones. Most main game bosses feel and look very cool and are fun to fight. Some people don't like the reuse of enemies throughout the game but overall, I think they did a good job of making them unique to the areas you fight them and the powers they use, making them feel like new enemies. Difficulty wise Elden Ring is probably the 2nd easiest soul's game with Dark Souls 2 being the easiest. With 85 deaths in Elden Ring total, 46 of which were due to Malenia leaving 39 from the rest of the game compared to, 38 deaths in Dark Souls 1, 55 deaths in Dark Souls 3, and 9 deaths in Dark souls 2 (DS2 just felt extremely easy). One problem I had was Malenia and her being able to use her waterfowl dance 5 times in the span of a 2 minutes using it every other attack, if I could change one thing, I would give that move a 60 second cool down after she uses it. Overall, Elden Ring has slight issues with difficulty balancing but they are so small that it doesn't change how amazing this game is.",1.0

One thing is I don't like the attribute system where you need a certain level of something to use something because I spent an hour hammering away at a boss only to be rewarded with a spell that I needed 40 faith to use when I only had 13.",0.8999999999999999
"I really wanted to like this game and the world was interesting to **** first. Then it got a bit repetitive. However, about 70% into the game, I simply could not progress. The difficulty is simply too much to handle for me. I really tried everything I could, but after 70 hours I just got sick and tired of dying hundreds of times. I do not find this to be fun at all. if the difficulty was even 10% easier, that could have been enough for me to progress further.",0.7000000000000001

The lands between is such an amazing open world map, the fact that everything you can see everything in the distance is really there is baffling, a lot of games simply put a jpg in the background and call it a day but in Elden Ring you can go to anything you see.

"I have been playing video games for more than 20 years now, but never have I enjoyed anything so unique and grand. The horrible difficulty fades into the background and gives way to the amazing art design and the unbelievable sense of exploration unmatched by any game ever made. I took my sweet time and conquered the Lands Between in every square meter, undigging all its secrets and stepping into every cave I could find. I got hooked on the loss of direction forcing me to explore every nook and cranny. Only Breath of the Wild could give me that sense of freedom before.

As a completionist, I found the mini dungeons extremely repetitive and not adding much in value as far as rewards. Also unfortunately the game suffers in balancing when you get to the late game.",0.8

"First off if you think Elden ring is “too hard” you’re not taking advantage of the games mechanics, there are plenty of ways to make the game easier if not too easy at times to be considered a souls game . First time playing I found it difficult until I figured out what areas to go to first and where to come back too. The areas in elden ring are set up perfectly to where you can progress without a serious challenge depending where you go next. If you have a problem with leveling up then you have yet to explore many areas because I found myself getting too strong for the main game . Lastly I hear a lot of complaints about the story being too hard to understand and I’m gonna tell you right now it’s only hard if you can’t put 2 and 2 together . You’re gonna need to google some words and maybe play the game a few times but you will understand the story as long as you can read and have an expanded vocabulary. Nearly every item description plays a role in telling you the story, you NEED to take your time and remember what npcs tell you . If you’re not able to do these things you will not understand anything and have a hard time for sure. And if you’re not willing to put in the work of unraveling this incredible story then don’t even bother writing a review about something you haven’t even fully experienced",1.0

"all time great ""souls like"" elden ring has a whopping 72 bosses and a insane amount of world to explore. Elden ring catches the players attention by throwing something new at them in every corner, want to go explore the crazy cool floating tree? oh look a castle on the side of the map for you to explore and get new weapons or items, elden ring is also rich in character customization and weapon selection, massive halberds, flaming swords, magic wands and enchantments you can cast upon them.

"The best Dark Souls style game. From Soft absolutely annihlates every single open world game every made(besides outerwilds and botw). Instead of cluttering you ADHD ridden brain will waypoints and objecitve markers found by climbing a ubisoft tower, elden ring actively hides its content in obscure places that prompt you to actually explore the map. The map itself is iconic and memorable. Most regions in the map are easily recognizable and enjoyable to explore. The combat is as refined as single player combat can become. Elden ring is almost like a competitive single player game in terms of how it makes you feel while playing.

This game can prove that you can definitely have too much **** thing. To say the map is big is a massive understatement. The verticality of the game world on top of the area size is absolute overkill. I haven't even reached the Capital yet and I feel. Burnt. Out. I'm so mixed on it. I love the world design but it does feel somewhat endless and a bit hollow? I do feel like tye enemies have more predictable attack patterns but the variety is there until you start to notice a somewhat shameless reuse of assets. This game has 165 Bosses! I think dark souls 2 only had 40 or so? I wish I could appreciate this game more and I respect the effort put into it. But somehow. Its too much for me personally. Which is weird. Maybe they should change the multiplayer mechanics so that you can interact with players in real time with no summon signs. Instead of summons it could end up being alot more organic. I'm sure covenants could still be implemented in some form or fashion. I just think if you're going to have such a large open world. You may as well make it more social. It would feel alot less empty I suppose as a result.,0.8

"Increíble. Un juegazo que todo el mundo debería probar. Su dificultad es menor a la de otros souls y premia la exploración. Si quieres usar invocaciones las usas, si quieres ir a pecho pelado puedes ir. No es necesario el ultra farmeo y no tiene carteles diciéndote a donde ir.

I have never played a FROMSOFTWARE game before and I usually don't like hard games but I now have 70 hours in the game and I am still only 80% through the game. There are so many new areas to explore and over 200 bosses. All in all I love this game.,0.0
Quite simply one of the best games of all time. Ive been gaming for 30 years and it is an incredible game. Think dark souls series but in an open world with a better storyline and plot. Ive seen some of the reviews on here and believe these are gamers whom havent played souls games prior to playing elden ring.,1.0
This game is a breathe of fresh air when it comes to the open world genre. It’s quality scenery shows up through out the entire game as a entire piece of art you get to participate in. Not only that the gameplay is phenomenal in its weapon choices and styles. The games can be difficult at times but using many of the games mechanics can help you get through hard areas. You can play the game in many different ways to make it fun. Overall in my 100+ hours I can say for a fact I enjoyed this game and it was worth playing.,1.0
"The game was my first ever 'souls-like' so take my review carely. I fall in love with this game, the story, the carachters, the gameplay, everything is put in the exact position you would wish. The score in not 10 out of 10 because a lot of boss/mini-boss are pretty much the same in all the game, but this in understable because the map is very big so i understand why is like that. Overall is a masterpiece for everyone",0.8
"By far the worst souls game ever made, the open world is extremely boring and full of copy+paste content. There is no fun way to traverse the open world. Boss fights are low quality and again a lot of them are copy+paste, I am talking about big story bosses that get shamelessly reused! It shows that FromSoftware didn't have enough time to develop this game properly. The boring empty open world is filled with wannabe pokemon summons called spirit ashe summons, you like collecting pokemons in your souls games? I don't. There is no meaningful reward, the game is too big for its own good, next time provide less quantity and more QUALITY, like previous souls games.",0.0
Fromsoftware did an amazing job with the unique open world that is elden ring. It dungeons may have been kinda copy and paste but still fun. The characters were interesting that follows up well with the fantastic story. The only problem i have with elden ring is that i feel that it isnt a new ip. Yes it may be in a new universe and everything but just like the dungeons everything feels copy and paste to dark souls. Bonfires? Naw grace sites. Stone/crystals? Naw fingers. You see what im saying. But overall elden ring is still a fantasic game i would recommend to anyone that wants a challenging game to play.,0.8
My life saved by this game. Best project by far. I love it so much. I.. I.. don't have any words to explain how i like this game. You need to be a dog to not try this piece of haven by youre self,1.0

"One of the worst open world games I've played.  The graphics are dated and uninspired.  Constant FPS issues even on console.  The publishers boasted that they consulted George R.R.  Martin for the story.  There is no story.  This game is a soul-less mess where players will constantly have to look up guides just to find out how to finish ""quests"".  Game difficulty is artificially too difficult in some parts with stupid gimmicks.  Boss fights are boring and repetitive.  The UI is horrible and many of the stats (for a stat based game) are not shown in game.  This is another game where the reviewers and various streamers are paid shills.  I would have more fun poking my dogs petrified poop for 12 hours with a stick on a 102 degree day then continuing to play this garbage game.",0.0

"That was my first entry in the ""Souls"" genre, and not the least I think. In my opinion, yes this is a diffcult game but it is manageable thanks to the rewarding exploration and the level up possibilities of your character. Games like Cuphead are way more difficult since you cannot power up to such an extent. I found the artistic direction is effective and coherent, musics subtle but adapted to the action and with powerful moments. Yes, jumps are unprecise, the story is somewhat vague but this game was really remarkable and somewhat unique to me, and there is clearly a before and after Elden Ring.",1.0

I rarely come across masterpieces nowadays and I've completed very few action or RPG games the last decade. And then came Elden Ring. Elden Ring is a masterpiece. I just finished putting just over 200 hours into my first playthrough, during which I searched every nook and cranny, tried to fight every enemy and boss, tried to find every item, tried to finish every quest, and accomplished most of that. A masterpiece. Beautiful. It's a modern and mature Zelda, a new gen and darker Skyrim with greater difficulty and less time-consuming and useless systems. It's grand. It's art. And I recommend it to every gamer. If you can get over the difficulty, you will be rewarded. And I never liked Souls-type games one bit before ER, but I see dopeness and beauty even in death in Elden Ring - how cool the enemy looks as he stalks over your body, the environment, the graphics and grandeur of it all.

Yes the visuals look better and you have a horse! But there's is no difference from ds3. After playing dark souls I thought elden ring would be different but the whole gameplay system, sounds, controls, movement and everything is reused from dark souls 3, and I'm burnt out on that.

"The guys have a half-truth in the ""complexity of such games"", this particular one is raw, they kill through the walls, the enemies often teleport or stand on the contrary (I just met this xs mb), but to say that ""this is a Masterpiece!"" in my personal opinion, insanity. Teach Don't Teach Boss Movements, of course this can help depending on the person and their degree of assimilation (and this is time and nerves, a **** cloud of nerves). So why is it needed at all, will it be fixed? Clean up bugs, right?And after all, the problems that I indicated above exist in many games that came out, but for some reason, the pancake ""master's creation"" scored 97 on metacritic, what did it deserve? The only thing to praise the game for is the visual, everything is half of the game, and most of it just migrated from other games in the series, including enemies and bosses with slightly changed textures (""Schaub is not exactly the same"" and some still scold ubisoft for monotony, seriously ?). So do you really need such a game with twisted boss stats, so that when you get 10-15 deaths, you go back to farm souls in the previous locations?In my opinion, this is **** I did not pay for the game, I confess, but I always do this, first the torrent if I feel that the game is worth it, I buy it.

This game has at least 100 hours of rewarding and exciting content on a first play through. The open world is refreshing and stands out amongst the crowd of mediocre Ubisoft games.

Customization is fantastic, you can select from many builds such as a glass cannon mage, a tanky knight or an adept bandit and that can be changed and reformed throughout the game. Elden Ring is the first FROM SOFTWARE game that I have played and it is excellent for beginners of the Souls sub-genre of games.

The bosses are fun for the most part and the open world always has somthing to find and lack the soullessness of modern open world games. No game is perfect and Elden Ring has a few quibbles, such as some of the bosses being a little too big for the camera to see and the lock on system is flawed.

"Elden Ring is a masterpiece and possibly my favorite game of all time, let me explain why. First of all, the gameplay. It is a hybrid of dark souls 3's combat system and general movement combined with aspects of Sekiro's mobility, such as jumping and stealth. In my opinion, it works perfectly well, combining methodical and agressive mechanicals into one. Secondly, the atmosphere and the open world. It truly is one of the most immersive games I've ever played. It's a beautiful game filled with diverse landscapes and beautiful music. Every area feels like your walking into a living, breathing painting. Next, the story in this game. It's fantastically vague and fleshed out, much like it's predecessors. The story itself is interesting and captivating, perhaps the best in the entire series. Now for the npcs and side quests. Almost every npc character in this game has a quest line. These are almost always amazing and generate a connection between the npc and the player. The problem of finding the npc in a hidden location is mostly gone now that a character marker has been added, although not completely. Finally, the cinematic and fantastic boss fights. My favorite part of all the souls games have always been the boss fights, duels with mythical knights and gigantic beasts are almost always done so well in the souls series. Elden Ring is no exception. So many bosses in this game are amazing! These aspects of the game add up to elden ring being a masterpiece. However, it's not perfect, nowhere near it.",1.0

"Pros- A massive open environment with nooks and crannies galore. The freedom to build your character the way you want, and respec (once you reach a certain point in the game) when you want to try a different play style are nice options to have. There is loot and weapons and armor galore, several different spirit ashes to find and use, which are essentially NPC's that you summon to help you in battle, and numerous different talismans which give you boosts to different abilities and stats. The freedom to truly mold you character into the type of fighter you want them to be is superb. The gameplay is mostly solid, and teaming up with a friend in co-op is a whole lot of fun. The game is gorgeous and the world is very immersive at times. The ability to sort of create your own stories within the game and talk about it with your friends is a highlight for sure. I'll never forget discussing strategies for certain areas and bosses with a couple of my friends that also play the game. Cons- Terrible camera angles at times. I don't know how many times I can legit blame dying on awful angles while fighting enemies in confined areas simply because I couldn't see them due to the camera positions. The targeting system when there are multiple enemies gets frustrating, and as fun as co-op is, they make it way too complicated to summon a friend. It seems ridiculous that I have to go farm plants to craft the items I need just to play cooperatively. Let me send them an invite and roam the Lands Between at will. I don't like that Torrent cannot be used at all during co-op either. It makes traversing the vast open world with friends seem more like a task than a good time. Story... Yeah. I just don't find it interesting. Not only is it really vague, but it is also bland and essentially non-existent at most times. There isn't much to keep me going other than the thrill of the next kill and a desire to explore. The NPC's are all stoic and dull, and lack personality. You feel no connection to anyone in the game. As far as RPG's go, this is at the bottom of the list in that aspect. I also dislike the total lack of hubs. No populated areas, whatsoever. Not one single town or city with any signs of life. That is more of a personal preference than a knock on the game, because that is obviously intentional to leave this type of thing out, but still- It makes the huge open world seem very bleak, lifeless, and empty. Several bosses are repeated, as are dungeons (outside of legacy dungeons and the main bosses) and that also eventually begins detracting from the overall experience. All in all, it's solid. I have plenty of gripes and opinions on what I think would make it a much better game, but that is all subjective, personal preference. If you are a fan of Souls games, you will most likely love this one. If you are used to open worlds such as The Elder Scrolls, Witcher 3, GTA, Red Dead, etc... You may feel like I do.",0.6

Every inch of the map is explorable and serves a purpose. The boss fights are intense and satisfying.

Genuinely one of my favorite gaming experiences and one of the few times I have taken the time to 100% complete an open world game.,1.0
This game is amazing… I always had Witcher 3 as the best game I have ever played but finally elden ring has stolen the spot. The games world building is awesome when you just start the game your just lost in this world. I get so sidetracked form the main story because the world is just so amazing to explore. The boss fights are top notch some better then other. But this is the game where you dream to be something you can be it. This game is for the hardcore fans and new ones. Just if you are new just give it sometime to get used to it and I promise once you get a hang of the movement’s and fighting controls it’s rewarding. But I have put in over 200 hours in this game and still find new stuff all the time. But this game deserves the praise the best I’ve ever played.,1.0
"Upon starting this game, I realized that I had underestimated how hard this game was going to be. I was unfamiliar with the levelling system, I had trouble with the combat, all of the symptoms of ""first souls game"" syndrome. After a while of trying, grinding, and dying, I finally understood. I finally understood the magical game hiding behind the difficulty mask. I was immersed in the breathtaking graphics, the complex lore, and the grinding of armaments. But be warned; and this is a bit of a hot take. The game only starts to be fun after you beat the first story boss. Even though I am very far from completing the game, I can confidently say that I am extremely happy and satisfied with my purchase of Elden Ring",0.8999999999999999

Horrible game.  Constantly get immediately killed in any area I explore.  Only critical hit from behind works.  No objectives are shown.  Guarding with shield does little to stop damage.  Can't tell if you've completed the objective in an area.  Can't tell the strength of the opponent.  I get that I normally have to work my up in level but then the game should start with the immediate areas around me being easy.  It offers a piece of equipment but then tells you it's not useful in its current form.  Young S/W developers with egos try to develop a game that beats the player.  Someone needs to tell them that the point of playing a video game is to have fun and enjoy it.  This game is miserable.  Waste of money.,0.0
"I have to be honest, at first I tought it is over-ranked.. But now, I am about only 26 hours in, 33rd level Samurai.. Man, I haven’t played better balanced open world game ever - it is simply art and so much to be unfold in front of me. There probably is story (probably like it was in Diablo II back than), but I didn’t really need to follow anything, I am just discovering this massive highly occupied world, meeting these unique foes, some of them bosses, some of them over my level - even harder than bosses, so opening this map and going elsewhere discovering something new. Along the journey realising, there were very few games that got stocked in my memories as a such a enjoyment as this one and we are really going to past at start of the 90s.. There is no doubt it is GOTY of 2022, this game right now aspires to be one of the greatest since Diablo II - if you loved that one, this one is must. If You loved Sekiro, this one is must. Revolutionary title, that got far beyond of the competition. We can all speak about Horizon, we all know, that Starfield or God of War probably will be great, but at the same time we know what previous titles from these studios were, gameplay never been the first thing - not in the way predecessors of the Elden Ring were - and gameplay is the thing for me, reason I wanna play. Don’t get me wrong, I love to watch, but I have HBO max, Netflix and etc for this. If we compare this game to Witcher 3, which is another great game, full of cutscenes, first try to openworld and it was just great - I really enjoyed it, but longer I played, interest were lower, story was interesting, but I just got in this feeling that every fight is same, no challange, after 15 hours of play and that is the way Witcher I remember ",1.0
One of the best games I've ever played! It could be a 10 but there are a few things holding it back. My biggest issues are with visuals. The game looks amazing but I've run into numerous glitches. Sometimes an enemy will disappear. One place I noticed this was a cave with large ants. Another was on a coast one just disappeared into a rock. Also sometimes the grass or other parts of the landscape seem to glitch out. I know some criticism comes from the difficulty but it's designed to make the player actually work to become better.,0.8
"Don't expect an open world full of things, this is a soul game, so you'll die a lot and the ""open world"" will be full of tough monsters/knights to farm in order to level up. Unfortunately, you'll have to rely on guides to find what to do at the beginning. The game is good, but certainly not goty! Graphics are disappointing for ps5/xbox series x, there's a lot of bugs. Gameplay is archaic. Fan of the Souls serie will love it, but again isn't for everyone and is certainly not as good as all the reviews says.",0.6

"I haven't finished elden ring yet, however, I suspect I'm getting close. This is my first souls type game, and I can say without a doubt this game is very accessible to players new to the painful power struggle that is a fromsoft game. That being said instead of praising the game I will point out my only real problem with the game. Simply put, the game is extremely unintuitive, this can be seen in the way lock-ons work, as well as in navigating the menus. This is nowhere more apparent than in the quest design, and I absolutely adore the open ended quest design, however there are a lot of times when you are given a quest unexpectedly, and then must remember a name or location with no way to repeat dialog. It's frustrating at times but the rest of the game completely sweeps away this frustration. TLDR: The HUD and Menus are bad, and the quest design is annoying",0.8999999999999999

It can feel like a 'Breath of the Wild' fever dream.  I've enjoyed FromSoftware games in the past but never to this level, each hour of play is rewarded with awesome weapons, unlockable items, enemies, and jaw dropping landscapes.  There are bug fixes needed, and it appears that they are being handled in a timely manner, and that is why for me this has been a close to perfect experience.",1.0

Dark Souls 3 and Bloorborne were good, though. So what's the difference ? Both were known for their excellent level design.

I couldn't have asked for more from this release by From Software. The game exceeded my expectations in every regard.,1.0
"My final and brief opinion on Elden Ring: They were right on many things, they were wrong on many others as well.  The first experience is incredibly memorable and the main bosses are amazing, the lore is nothing to talk about, although I think it's very similar to Dark Souls and lacks a bit of originality.  The problem is that there comes a point, more precisely in the second half of the game, that it gets very repetitive, the optional bosses are very forgettable, the boss repetition is ridiculously annoying and the game balance is so unstable to the point that you are OP without nor make effort, spoiling the Experience.  The soundtrack is far inferior to past games, especially if we compare it to Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne, you can count on your fingers which ones are really memorable and incredible.  The exploration of the world itself is phenomenal and intuitive, it's really a revolution of the open world system, but unfortunately that's only true for the first time playing, making the game have very little replay factor, as you've already seen all the new exploration. In short, the game is amazing and extremely fun and addictive, it has a lot of successes but it also has a lot of flaws.  For FromSoftware's first open world game, I'd say they are to be congratulated, they improved a lot from the other games, but honestly it could have been better.  If they had more creativity and time, the game would be immensely more memorable and most of the game's serious flaws would be minimized.  Overall, it's an unforgettable game on your first playthrough and it's really worth it, it's not quite a masterpiece as many have said, for me it's basically an open world Dark Souls 4, but it's worth the investment, especially nowadays where the market of Videogames only cares about money and quantity, while FromSoftware cares more about the artistic factor and quality in their games. Final rating: 8/10",0.8

"This was my first FromSoft game and I never expected to finish it because of that. But I just finished with my 3rd playthrough and got 100% of the achievements. The game is that good. It is really fun to just explore around conquering bosses as you come across them. There are hidden secrets everywhere, it doesn't feel like any of the space is wasted like in so many open world games. It does have some problems though. The first problem is that there is no quest interface whatsoever. There are certainly quests, just no way to keep track of them without doing it manually (eg. pen and paper) or the more realistic solution: just google everything. The 2nd big issue is that co-op is just backwards. With most games with jump-in co-op you would ask for help, and people answer. In this game, people have to volunteer to help and then wait around for someone to ask for it. If you want to just co-op the entire game with friends, well you can't, it doesn't work that way. Co-op ends as soon as a player dies or a boss does and you have to set it up all over again. Definitely could have been done better.",0.8999999999999999

Having very little experience completing a souls game. I put myself at the task of finally taking down this game. It took a lot of work multiple restarts of new characters finding different styles and guides to help me out. Yes I did beat it first using the astrologer. It was not easy by no stretch in fact my second time through the game I did the vagabond and used the glorious golden halberd which did make most bosses feel super easy but once I took one the dual wielding great swords did this game feel truly special. All of this to say that the freedom in this game is what truly sets itself apart from former games in the series and the unguided nature of the game sets it apart from other open world games minus a few that did it first. I recommend giving this game a try and once you do finally beat this massive undertaking give new game plus a try as well and don’t be afraid to hit every single spot in the game it makes it that much sweeter.,0.8999999999999999

There is a fine line between difficult and dumb/irritating. I'm a big Metroid fan, so hard games arent usually an issue. But this game just makes itself hard for the sake of it. It's not fun, it's just boring. The controls arent responsive enough imo to warrant the difficulty. I'm level 155 and the game goes from killing soliders with one hit to getting my ass handed to me in two hits by the same soldiers 2 minutes later. In summary, the game isnt fun. It's tedious",0.6

"Full disclosure, I am a fairly big fan of the Dark Souls series of games and have been playing Souls games for nearly a decade now; so take that into consideration. With that out of the way, I would like to say that Elden Ring is simply incredible. I have not experienced a newly released RPG that has enthralled me this much with its world and gameplay since Fallout 4 - back in 2015. The diversity in builds and play styles, the humongous amount of interesting dungeons and environments, the plentiful and awesome loot, and of course the difficult but very fun to fight enemies and bosses - all of these elements are done very, very well in Elden Ring. There are some technical problems here and there, mainly with the frame rate and some controller delay - but this will not destroy the awesome experience. As a send off I want to say this, Elden Ring is not short and it does not hold your hand, this could seem overwhelming to some gamers, but I want to say that Elden Ring hardly ever felt like a chore. While Elden Ring is a long game, it's so open and has so much in it that I hardly felt like I was spending too much time playing it. Even if you are crunched for time from work or school, I still would highly recommend trying out this awesome game.",1.0

"This has to be my absolute favorite Souls-like and From Software game. The game delivers on its promises of retaining that soul's formula. This game had me dying in my first 5 minutes of playtime. This will come across as frustrating for some, but that's what it's intended to be. The open-world nature of the Lands Bettwen is majestic in even the most colorless regions. One of the main reasons I found Sekiro to be boring is that all locations had the same feel. Most of the enemies were natural and earthly, looking to be rememberable. Elden RIng is everything I was hoping for in a From game. And if I could give a more accurate rating, I would give this a 9.9 because Elden RIng, in my eye, is flawless in world-building and charter design. I have one major criticism of the game, and I admit it is quite a funny criticism. In my eye, it has one of the worst opening theme songs in any of the From games. But besides that main criticism, this game is flawless and my pick for a possible match of the year.",0.8999999999999999

Elden Ring is one of the best experiences I’ve ever had in general and the world would be a better place if everything was made with so much care and respect for the target audience.",1.0

"After a rough start on xbox side of things, this game is now a true masterpiece. Definitely as of writing this in March is the GOTY and probably will be top contender come the end of the year still. Though the game doesnt hold your hand throughout like most open world MMO games it is balanced enough so that you can go out explore as much as you want and still have a sense of direction on the path to complete game via sites of grace placed throughout the massive world. With dangers around every corner and bosses ranging from small to towering giants this game has it all, the added ability to play with your friends and explore together is a much loved bonus. Because sometimes (most times) you'll find yourself needing that extra hand to help defeat a boss or dungeon. No friends to play eith? No worries elden rings also gives you thr ability early on to summon spirits to your side to help you fight and defeat enemies as well as summon random players from other worlds into yours to help, along with you being summoned to theirs if wanted. In all this game really dies have it all. And will leave you wondering what's next throughout as you rise your steed around slashing or using magical abilities to decimate hordes of enemies.",1.0

"This game is going to be the best game of this year, I strongly recommend playing it on Xbox Series X, the only platform where it does not give problems with lag or fps, from software did it again but this time better than ever, it brought together the best of all the video games they have released to date in one, with a beautiful open world as well.",1.0

"Lets start by saying i will not be referring to this game as a masterpiece as that horse has been beaten to death? Elden Ring is a good game, but that's it. Its dated as F! In fact it brought back memories of Dragons Lair for me. Move left - swing sword - move right - back step - swing sword what year is it? The exploration in the game is by far the only reason it gets as high a score from me personally. Its super fun to explore and find new places and enemies to kill but this game is so repetitive, repetitive, repetitive, repetitive. Boss battles are the same, enemies everywhere are the same. It's a great step in a the right direction but if you're going to open your world map then you got to have a reason to live in it, it has to be an interesting place for me to ROLE PLAY. Not overly difficult if you level up and explore the world for better gear and weapons, but why else would you be playing an RPG. Combat is simple and fair most of the time and by fair i mean if you get hit you get punished, that's what these games are about. Sadly because that mechanic is so old and stale once you master moving and taking small bites you can really own this game. Its good but not as good as some other RPG'S over the years. Like Dragons Lair in the arcades as a kid a lot of people got pissed off the game was so hard and wanted their Quarters back. But if you just learned the patterns to the dungeons the Quarters started to go really far. If people were still buying physical copies of games Elden Ring would have its own pre-owned bin at every location. Solid 7/10",0.7000000000000001

May seem rude but my entire playthrough was built on sword of night and flame. I know it was OP but it made this game enjoyable for me. It didn’t hurt anyone else. All my upgrades were poured into that build along with how my stats were. I can reset stats but the upgrades I used on the weapon and other things have made it a waste. I will most likely start the game over and eventually it will get shelved.,0.0
"I'm not a new player, I've been playing Fromsoft games since way back, Kingsfield 1. They've only gotten better and better and better through the years. This game, as a continuation of their brand, is a perfect and awe-inspiring offering. For a huge fan of the Dark Souls Series this game is the ultimate fan wish-fulfillment by a game maker. The formula they've honed is nearly perfected here, and the expansion of features and ideas, gameplay and story twists and turns, and incredible presentation all add up to a game experience I will remember for all my days left on this earth. Play with friends for a more challenging but fun experience of on-foot Elden Ring. Single-player horse jumping is tons of fun too, go Torrent! I look forward to multiple playthroughs of this masterpiece. Fingers forever!",1.0
"The best game from this studio so far. Everything about this game surpasses all the open worlds I've played in the last ten years.

"What you should really take note of here is these “0” out of 10 reviews,    Note how much they read more like petulant hyperbole than anything close to a critique.     Well that’s because to expect this game to be different than the other Fromsoft games is ignorant at best,    It takes what works from the rest of their work and finally starts to trim away from the fat that made prior games more like exclusionary niche titles and opened the genre to be much more accessible.      The game never seems to stop opening up into new areas to explore and when played alongside friends has created a gaming experience I’ve found lacking in the industry for a longerg time.    The open world allows for moving around and away from moments that served as roadblocks in prior titles.    Can’t beat that boss?    No problem, just go level up or try out a new weapon set up and come back.    No  more banging your head against the wall as you do the same fight for the 50th time.     You can go at your own place and there is more variety to the game than just big sword smash and roll.        And while the graphics are far from cutting edge, the game reminded me how little that matters in a game.        Thanks for the stories Fromsoft, can’t wait to see what’s next.",1.0

Wow. Just wow. This is my second FromSoft souls type game and it’s amazing. I’m still half way through it but I had to leave a rating. I’ve put 50hrs into this game and I still have so much more to find and do. The graphics are amazing. There isn’t 50 map markers telling me to do some lame side quest. Every other open world game has repetitive side quests. I don’t have to spend half my time playing the game picking up materials (Horizon forbidden west). I find a map and I look at it. I see something on the map that looks interesting and I go there. I get a boss fight and badass loot. This is what a Medieval style game should be like. It’s challenging. It’s a long game if you play it that way. It’s not filled with BS to have bragging rights that it takes X time to complete it. It’s An amazing experience. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game to anyone who isn’t easily frustrated. Lol. Game on.,0.8999999999999999

so far this game is game of the decade for me. it 100% the best souls game we have gotten I am about 3 hours in and I love it. way to much fun for me.

I went into this game with an open mind and loved it. this game is blowing my mind. plus I play on the series s and the game looks insane. I wish more people would give this game a try and not hate on it to be different. just because you can kill one boss come back later when you get some runes and levels. trust me it helps a lot. can someone tell me how this game looks like dark souls 3 a game that was gray and brown everywhere; this game look nothing like that not even close.,1.0
"El juego es excelente y para ver lo bueno hay miles de review el tema es lo malo y que no lo hace un 10/10 y a mi criterio es, en la exploración muchas veces el objeto a descubrir es un pedazo de planta que no sirve para nada, o un hongo, debieran de haber incluido en estas zonas más materiales de mejora de armas, ya que  es un problema la escasez de los mismos, debido a que por lo general uno va a empezar a mejorar un arma de arranque de la partida y la verdad q no hay forma de saber si el arma encontrada a las 60hs de estar jugando va a escalar mejor o peor que la que tenemos equipada, por lo tanto van quedando relegadas al inventario de a decenas y solo usaremos 4 o 5 en toda la partida, quizás hubiera sido mejor resumir el juego a 12 armas como lo hizo bloodborne. Otro punto negativo son las quest secundarias, en estas si hubiera hecho falta algún tipo de indicador o un guiño del personaje de donde encontrarlo la próxima vez o de que hacer, por que literal es imposible completarlas sin mirar una guía, lo cual le quita al juego ese extra de andar a ciegas y lo convierte en algo monótono el tener q ver una guía, volver al juego ir a ese punto x tener un dialogo, volver a la guía, ver el siguiente paso, volver al juego, hacerlo..... arruina la experiencia. Fuera de eso es un excelente juego y la realidad por ahora es que la dificultad está presente al inicio, una vez alcanzado el nivel 60  con tu arma favorita en +17 algún stat de fuerza o destreza en 40  y unas cenizas de invocación  en +6 la dificultad baja al 50%. Por ejemplo arranque el juego como  es esperado y en lugar de ir a la segunda y tercera zona, me fui para la cuarta el desafío era alto pero la fue peleando y lo completo hasta donde se podía, y luego al ir a las zonas que en realidad eran la 2 y 3, me la estoy pasando matando a enemigos poderosos de 4 golpes   .para resumir tiene una duración monstruosa ya que explorando al 100% y jugando sin guías a la primera recurrendo luego a ellas para sacar el 100 de lo que ofrece cada una de las zonas, con quest incluidas, llevo unas 60 hs y calculo que recién un 50% del juego, y aun sigo enganchado cosa que no me paso con otro mundo abierto",0.8
"Having played Demon Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro, this isn't my first rodeo with FromSoftware and I'm really digging the NOT HOLDING YOUR HAND APPROACH open world aspect to a souls like game. The UI takes some getting used to but is NOT the garbage that has spewed out of the mouths of prominent developers of other game franchises. (Ubisoft and Guerilla could definitely learn something from this) Story wise it's minimalistic but well done and unique. My medieval fantasy cup of tea. Control wise it's really a matter of understanding the mechanics. If you're not used to souls like mechanics the controls are going to seem poor to you. The graphics are top notch particularly on quality mode. Performance wise...I'm really dissatisfied with it on my Series X. My hope is that FromSoftware steps up to the plate to remedy this.

"Elden Ring has quickly become one of my favorite games of all time. The world and aesthetic is beautiful and I find myself frequently getting sidetracked by some new dungeon or a unique town or area that just makes me want to explore it all. The combat is as fluent as ever, FromSoft has perfected their style and it's as fun as it has ever been. I've seen people talk about how bad the graphics are or how many issues they've discovered. The graphics may be somewhat dated, but it doesn't take away from how much I enjoyed the game. The only issue I've come across was when I was trying to load into a friend's world to help them with a boss, but when I loaded I received the ""enemy felled"" message and was sent back to my world. The issue was quickly resolved though, but was still annoying at the time. The story is vague, like many other FromSoft games, but there is just so much more in just item descriptions alone that interested me. I haven't beaten every boss yet, but I have dumped 60 hours into the game and overcome some of the more challenging enemies in the game. The fights are tough, but always fair. I haven't encountered a boss that was that I genuinely didn't enjoy fighting. My only issue are the sidequests. Sometimes they're hard to keep track of and some of the npcs would move to a location that just seemed random until the added context later in the quest, . Eventually it made sense, but it didn't make it any less tedious trying to find where they were in the massive world. I know FromSoft likes to be minimalistic with stuff like that, but some kind of log to just keep track of what quest I had started would have been appreciated. Overall, the game isn't the most graphically advanced and definitely has some issues, but I've been enjoying the game so much despite the few issues I did run into. The world is aesthetically beautiful and there are endless possibilities with exploration still left. I can't wait to fill out the rest of my map and maybe find some secret areas and fell more enemies.",0.8

"I’m a completionist of DS and Sekiro, IMO this is From Software’s closest attempt at making the perfect souls-type game.  Open world significantly exceeded my expectations with visually stunning and varied regions, fighting mechanics aren’t quite as sharp and unforgiving as Sekiro but incorporate some new elements, dying is less inconvenient than in previous souls games, and storytelling has been stepped up while staying true to From’s signature style of starting vague with a big picture and unraveling the details as you go.  Huge replay value.  Easily in my top 5 modern games of all time list.",0.5

This game is made for **** **** souls players only. I wasn’t familiar with their games and I wish I was . You spent the whole **** game rolling from enemies there’s no direction in the game what so ever . This game is basically any game just put on very hard mode with no quest helper. Honestly it’s nothing special don’t waste your money your lol regretting wasting hours and accomplish nothing,0.1
"Love the gameplay mechanics and the overall game and quest line is super fun and addicting. With lots of areas to explore you can level up at your own rate without the game feeling too “grindy” or overbearing. This is a huge improvement over their past releases. Also, I love that you now have a save point right before the boss! This makes it better for learning boss moves and over coming the challenge. Great game!",1.0

It is with zero hyperbole that I say that Elden Ring is the most ambitious game I have ever played. The sheer amount of hours it must have taken to make this game is honestly baffling and I never thought games could reach this level of craftsmanship. I dont know if video games as a whole have just gotten more soulless but Elden ring literally took my back to the sense of wonder and adventure I started playing games in the first place for. You'll be playing and you'll finish a huge challenge and then you're rewarded with this insane view that just takes your breath away. . This game is incredible and I had to review this simply for the fact that I saw other people giving it zeroes.  If you're a gamer  you will be missing out if you do not play this.,1.0

"I’m guessing people are giving this a score below 6 because they got caught up in the hype and didn’t realise the game was… hard. The visuals are some of the best I have ever seen in a videogame, I bet the people saying it looks like an old Bethesda game have played for about 30 minutes and gave up at the first real boss fight which they didn’t realise was optional. I wish I could post images here. The early game bosses are way harder compared to Dark Souls 3’s early game bosses. Gameplay-wise, it’s mostly like the previous FromSoftware titles. The game is so good that the framerate drops don’t even bother me in the slightest. Buy it, if you’re up for the challenge.

"Honestly such an amazing game. I love the fact that you rarely see markers on the map and you can adventure the land to discover stuff on your own. It doesn't have any handholding, nothing that tells you where to go typically. The thing that differentiates this from most other open world games is that the devs of other games want to show you their work, but from wants you to discover it. Its got a huge open world to discover and tons of challenges to face, I feel like the issue most people may have is the fact that its fighting takes time to learn, which makes some encounters really difficult, but other that I love this game.",1.0
"As a long time fan of Fromsoft's Dark Souls trilogy, Elden Ring takes the cake as the best of them all. I'm naturally a skeptical person and don't go throwing around the phrase ""the best"" too often. They plucked and dropped some of the best features from all of their past games and beautifully orchestrated them together with an interesting original story and produced a masterpiece. The music in ER is amazing as well and deserves recognition. There are a lot of reviews on here, and all over the internet, that make ER sound like the worst game ever made. A minute sum of these reviews and comments are valid and bring up reasonable points. However, a majority of them are emotionally motivated and charged by the overwhelming popularity this game has imbued. In the end, Elden Ring will go down as one of the greatest ever in-spite of the negative ""reviews"" a few ""gamers"" made because they couldn't git gud.",1.0

"I’m convinced that these low user reviews haven’t even played the game. Soulless? Uninspired? Bad graphics? None of these things have been an issue for me. Sure the graphics aren’t AAA level, but the art direction more than makes up for that. I haven’t entered a world that has more character to it since Skyrim. This game is brilliant, and is greater than the sum of its parts. Especially weird are the reviews saying “Forbidden West is better”??? This is not a flawless game, but it is still an amazing one. If you give it a chance and have the patience to learn from dying instead of getting angry, then please don’t let the negative user scores throw you off. If you can’t handle dying or don’t like overcoming adversity, then don’t play it. If you like all the aspects and areas of your open worlds thoroughly explained so that there is no mystery or discovery, then this game is not for you. If you are a human being with a brain and an ability to learn and think critically then this game IS FOR YOU.",0.8999999999999999

This is the first souls like game I have played (outside of dark souls) where I put in 40 hours almost and love it. I just got the game last Friday. I hated dark souls, played it for 5 hours and quit when it came out. This has just the right amount of difficulty. For those complaining I am sorry I said what I said but get good, or go on YouTube and figure out how to become a badass in the world.

Games good. Its another FromSoft special. People complaing about graphics generaly dont know what bad graphics are because they are from this generation of hardware. The difficulty is what makes these games if you cant start like everyone else at the start of the game go do something else. This game is based on your skill as a player if you find a stratagy that works you win if you dont you die. I said this before game developers need to add an acheivment of I bought that or I earned that. You get a Trophe by beating the game on a base difficulty that ships with game or you can buy the trophe for a doller and yhey give you a game breaking weapon. The point is you ether have the skill to win or admit you cant do it and have a mark that shows it. If your not haveing fun why are you playing after you desided the game isnt to your taste? That doesnt make a game bad it means you didnt enjoy it. I saw a 0 review on here saying that the deves promised the game would have there language avalable. I understand this persons review. If the deves posted offically that the game would be in my language and it wasnt id be negative to.,0.8999999999999999
Hands down this is the BEST game I’ve played in 10 yrs. I have 100+ hrs into it and still haven’t seen and done everything and not once got bored or tired of it. This is basically what I call an open open world game. It doesn’t hold your hand and tell you how great you are. You earn your way through it every step and it takes a lot of what made Zelda/Skyrim great and puts some Dark Souls into them. It’s utterly brilliant and the themes and art are incredible. If this was the last game I ever played I’d be at peace with it. Best $ I ever spent on anything in last decade. Only drawbacks are fact it’s not a showboat title for graphics and it’s tough until you figure it out. When you do-it’s best experience in gaming.,1.0

"Elden Ring is all of FromSoftware's experience combined into one game with a vast open world to boot. Most open world games while huge are empty, Elden Ring's world is not. It's bright, lively, and enchanting while also being dark, gritty, and terrifying. It becons the player to go out and explore regardless of what challenges may be around each corner. The combat is a deep and intense as ever, with plenty of options for the player to explore and tailor their playstyle. And as always the boss's are as difficult as ever with some boardering on the insane. The sheer creativety of the monstrosities that have been created are jaw-dropping. Thankfully you do not have to face these challenges alone with the online co-op and the new spirit summoning system to ease your troubles on this long journey. The story is interesing but elusive which will require multiple playthroughs to fully squeze the blood from this stone, giving the game even more replay value. I highly recommend giving this game a shot but understand that while it is the most accessible FromSoftware title it is a challenge. You will die. A lot.",1.0

Honestly the best game I've played by FromSoft with the one and only knock is that there are many many ways to make this game easier to play. HOWEVER! It doesn't hurt my opinion of it because I simply choose not to use those methods the fact that the game allows for so many different builds and play stylesthat any one can play however they want go wherever they want and fight whoever they want. It's phenomenal Elden Ring was worth the wait worth every penny and easily one of my favorite games,1.0

World rendering, Weapon clipping and hitbox issues. However a majority of the bosses are fresh and fun and great. Some bosses are just lazy but other Dark  Souls games have had this issue. But this doesnt excuse them from repeating the mistake. I am aiming to give a fair review because I feel a ton of the reviews have been inflated and are not living in reality. The Lore falls short and flat compared to its siblings of Dark Souls and Bloodborne but makes up for it for the fresh attempt. I am writing it a 7 for the boring first few hours of the game. It really does pick up near the end of the game but it is not a masterpiece by any means. It is good, not great and not perfect. But a very solid game that deserves love and should be open to criticism.",0.7000000000000001

I mean did you see the Erdtree?! . Now some people might get this game and think it will be a little different in terms of difficulty, but no. this is still that classic hard souls experience. but you have way more tools to make the game a little easier. for example, spirit summons. spirit summons are AI you can spawn to help you in boss battles. they don't do a lot of damage but they distract the boss so you can get some hits in. overall  this game is a must-play that I would recommend to any fan of the soul's genre",1.0

"Again, From Software has released another excellent game in the Souls series. An amazing adventure awaits anyone who is brave enough to trek across the treacherous lands of the first open world game in the series. With a class to suit anyone's play style, players will be thrown in to a world with danger awiting them around every corner.  Although the game is superb for the most part, I would have like to see and actual upgrade graphic wise. But graphics are everything,  and Elden Ring delivers in every other department.  So set forth,  and test you skill, as well as your patience!",0.8

If you're an open world fan, this game has a gigantic open world that you can pretty much explore at will.  However, the gaming ""media"" has severely overrated this game.  It should be sitting 65 to 70, not the 90 whatever it has.  Way way way too many technical flaws on all consoles and PC.",0.6

Elden Ring is one of the greatest games I’ve ever played and in my opinion one of the best video games ever made. I have no complaints. Its a masterpiece. It can be quite difficult, but that’s the type of games that FromSoftware makes. The game is gorgeous, fun, challenging, and incredibly satisfying. I’m 52 hours in and probably only halfway done. It’s just filled to the brim with content.",1.0

"This is my first time playing a souls like game. I’m not sure I could go back to the other games but it’s definitely on my to do list after I continue to play Elden Ring. I’m 40 hours in and it’s just amazing. There is so much to do and so much to explore. The game is tough but it gives you multiple ways to come back and to level up. You can even summon spirits, NPCs or other online players to help you through an area or boss. A big thing to note going in is you are going to die, and die alotttttt. Be prepared don’t throw your control; try not to rage quit. Just leave go level up or explore. This game is beautiful and is full of life. Highly recommend.

"A wildly overrated game. Dated visuals, surprisingly poor performance, sluggish controls, and a played out dark fantasy setting, this is not a 10/10 game far from it.

"It’s funny to see people who clearly haven’t played anything more challenging than mainstream bait titles zelda botw, ghost of tsushima, assassin’s creed and whatnot, complain about a game that has a 10+ year long history of having the same solid mechanics set in stone. They don’t realize that the difficulty of these games comes from THEM being a **** player because they were seasoned with the titles stated above, titles that reward you for being a **** player. They are not used to challenges. They want quest markers, dungeon markers, npc markers on the map. They want a difficulty setting. They don’t get what “roleplaying” means in these games. You’re not playing as some killing machine that can crush every single enemy as if they were tin cans, you’re playing as a person who seeks to be that strong one day, and you DO become that strong come late game. I hate that this game became a mountain of hype. Sorry but, the souls series doesn’t deserve this treatment. I don’t know why they decided to open it up to the general, more stupid audience. If this game had the same fanbase DS3 had at its release, I guarantee you it would’ve had a fan review score of 98-99. This game is literally the closest game we’ve had to perfect in its respective genre. Sorry for the long comment, I just felt like they didn’t do justice to this masterpiece of a video game franchise.",1.0

"I'm not going to lie to you, it's pretty hard. The game lacks difficulty options, forcing players to either rise to the occasion and enjoy the rigor of fights where you dodge attack after attack performed by colossal bosses, or get mad because they can't manage to time their rolls and write a bad review on metacritic. That being said, the game does feel a bit grindy in the beginning, especially if giants scare you. It also lacks a simple main story, opting instead to give detail and plenty of backstory to its npc's and the world itself and making you the player figure things out. Your destiny won't be found nested in dialogue options, lengthy cutscenes, and a clear-cut path, it'll be what you make it. If you're up for the challenge, get Elden Ring and enjoy one of the greatest games out there.",1.0

I have no complaints and I appreciate the look of the games I play. I’m 30 hours in and I have to say I’m impressed. They have done an excellent job on this one and it’s can’t miss in my book.

Everything attacks so fast, there’s no breaks to get in a shot without taking damage, or to heal. Everything one shots you even when you’re leveled up, it’s just not as good as the other from soft games. I don’t know what they were thinking with this.

All in all Elden Ring is a game of exploration that will keep you coming back for more.

The art style is gorgeous. It is clear fromsoft put time and effort into this creation. Everything is placed in the world and has a reason for being there. It is incredible to me that they were able to create this in just over 2 years of development. This is also the most accessible soulsborne game, while also being one of the most challenging I’ve played. Keep in mind my review is solely based on my experience in my 30 hours, yes I am a fromsoft fan, so I’ve tried to avoid bias in this review, and I’ve taken off the rose colored glasses to fully experience these opening hours.

You can have so much fun just exploring the map and the process of getting just a little better every excursion is thrilling.

While this is not that bad considering the character models and some environments look like early ps4 it’s disappointing. Multiplayer could be phenomenal but is bogged down by bad design choices. One example is walls that forces you to disband group at region zones and have your friends try to get to the point where you’re at alone just so you can progress after you get past the wall. Others include mounts and summons not working. These two features are so core to the single player experience that it is baffling that they couldn’t optimize their game enough to have them included.

That does not mean that repeating the formula gives you many hours of exploration and why not? of frustration. In general it is a very inflated game by the media, it is not even remotely what they wanted to make it seem. It is not perfect, it is not open to all, where is the objectivity? It's a shame that they behave like this.",0.3
"Best game Fromsoft has ever put out,  hands down. It does have frame drops but if you have a VRR monitor it'll help a ton until a patch is out (hopefully). It can be a rough go for those not used to this style **** but my advice is to not give up, if you get stuck on a boss or a big enemy maybe explore the world more, level up and try again. If you have a friend, get them to help you out or use summoning spirit's! Watch some tutorials on YouTube, the game doesn't give you much info on mechanics and tips. You will die, a lot. You will lose souls..... I mean runes, hopefully not a lot but it will happen. I've learned after playing all the Souls games,  you roll with the punches, laugh it off and have fun! I love the visuals, though they have some rough edges,  the sounds is great and the gameplay is fantastic once you understand it. It's a unique experience gamers should try and dive deeper cause it only gets better with time. About 55 hours in and I feel like there's so much more to discover.",0.8999999999999999

Exploration is continually rewarded in the world. The bosses are difficult but there’s always the option to leave and come back to fight another day once you’ve leveled up and gained more knowledge. I recommend players keep a notebook or notes file on their computer/phone open to keep track of important details that may be forgotten if not written down. If you’re feeling frustrated by a part of this game, this is most likely by design. It never hurts to use the internet to look up a topic you may be confused about.

This game brings all the best from all fromsoftware games, even Sekiro, to build up the best game you can ask for. THERE IS A REASON but Souls games are not for everyone, the game doesn´t hold your hand, doesn´t babysit you, it challenges you, it brings the best of you, not everyone are truly comfortable with this kind of liberty, many need a hand on their shoulders.

"If this game actually ran properly I’d give it a mega high score, but unfortunately it just doesn’t run very well on the series x, I returned it as was told it runs better on the PS5, which oddly enough I does, on the series x the frame rate was very very up and down for me, I wouldn’t say unplayable, but close, at the moment I’ll give it a 5, if they sort the frame rate out and lock it at 60fps 1440p or 1800p or some thing like that I’d score the game very highly, as it is an absolutely fabulous game from what I’ve seen, but in a game which is so highly dependent on skill and timing you just can’t have these major dips in frames, sorry if I piss people off as it’s not my intention but it does seem to run a lot better on the PS5 and the dips in frame rate are no we’re near as noticeable or constant, I thought PC would be the way to go but I also avoided that as a friend got it, who has a very very good pc RTX3090, I9, 32GB top end gaming ram etc… and said it runs absolutely terribly far worst then the consoles even, hopefully all this can be rectified with patch’s but at the moment I can’t recommend this for the series x or the pc.",0.5

"Let me start off by saying the game artistically looks amazing. However the serious lack of details up close is a bit sad. They're something you would see early PS4/XBO days. The quality mode helps a little, but that mode is nearly unplayable, so hard to consider that an option. There also no quest list or journal, no map pin system, no hand holding of any kind which is kind of fun and kind of irritating at the same time. I like some bit of structure, it doesn't need to be Bethesda level of hand holding though. It also had a fun aspect to it when you're not repeating the same attempt for the 12th time. I played some of the other dark souls and blood borne games when I was younger, but didn't play them very long due to the difficulty. Now that I'm in my 30s I don't mind sticking to it longer but without that historical Souls franchise experience, it is very difficult and very frustrating. I've been playing since launch and still haven't beat the first boss. Watch video, gotten advise and still can't get it done. I would have liked to try it coop but ya know it didn't work for days and I still haven't gotten to try it.  From what I've seen, it's really not that dynamic of a coop anyway so I'm weary. Overall the game is fun  ut is very frustrating not just for difficulty but the broken online mode, meh graphical details, lack of basic features, and crazy clunky fighting mechanics. Basically, if you're not already a Souls die hard with a clear bias for this type of game, this game is just good but not good enough. Too bad the critics couldn't see past their bias.",0.7000000000000001

"A masterpiece based upon a foundation laid by George R.R. Martin, and further developed by director Hidetaka Miyazaki, and the development team, From Software, Elden Ring has captivated me unlike any game has before. The Lands Between consist of beautifully artistic scenery and level design, alluring incentives for exploration, fluid combat, and many diverse, challenging bosses. The narrative is firmly present within the environment yet little is mentioned of it, thus allowing for some extrapolation by the player. The more tense combat encounters are accompanied by Yuka Kitamura's masterful work as a sound designer and composer, which has been developed throughout nearly a decade of work on other similar games by From Software. Though its identity is distinctly its own, Elden Ring nonetheless shares many similarities with its predecessors, the Dark Souls trilogy and Bloodborne, and truly feels like the culmination of From Software's work on them. Of the many video games I have tried throughout the last decade, my experience with Elden Ring is confidently my favorite. Despite what I've attempted to convey, this game simply must be experienced personally to truly appreciate it.",1.0

To call it the greatest of all time you need more than just a good game play, it's missing the graphics, story, music and optimization.

"Elden ring is not a perfect game but it is a good one, and if you are a fan of previous soulsborne games you will most likely enjoy this game. For new players this game might be harder to enjoy early on due to its lack of guidance and what can be a frustrating combat system and currency/xp system, if you are unexperienced with souls likes. Elden ring also has a few technical issues, like server issues that will hopefully be cleaned up fairly soon and some texture and occasionally enemy pop **** open world also has a bit of a lower level of quality compared to the more detailed and interesting legacy dungeons, but none the less the open world is still rich with things to do and find. Sometimes the world can look a little outdated graphically but there are moments that truly do shine. Like when you are standing on top of a tower looking over to see the castle you have just finished fighting a challenging boss in, or the dense forest you escaped moments before. The bosses in elden ring vary from being great to more on the level of filler. Not that they are poorly designed just that you may fight a boss and then a have very similar enemy appear somewhere else that is just considered a slightly stronger foe in your path or multiple similar bosses scattered around the world, which can feel a little repetitive. Overall though the experience, designs of dungeons, enemies, sometimes breathtaking vistas, interesting characters and a very well detailed world and lore. Triumphs most of the issues that can be found with Elden ring. This is a game any fan of fromsoftware should pickup, and any interested new comers should maybe watch a few YouTube videos on, to understand what kind of experience they are going to get them selves into before purchasing.",0.8999999999999999

"This is, without a doubt, the best game I’ve ever played. The world is teeming with life, with seemingly everywhere having a special enemy, dungeon, or secret. A strange item causes a ghost to appear and lead you to a cave. A telescope with a birds eye view lets you look around the world differently. A small elevator leads to a massive, beautiful cavern with inexplainable stars. I became engrossed with this massive world after only a few hours, and have now spent almost 15 of my last 22 hours since receiving my copy simply exploring. My friend who’s never played a souls game has already called it the best he’s ever played, and my group are having the times of our lives simply exploring and levelling up. I would highly suggest anyone to get this game, and think it redefines what a game should do.",1.0

"Well, I definitely don’t recommend this game. The gameplay is awkward and repetitive, not satisfied playing it. The world is totally empty, not vast and rich as some reviewers are saying, everything looks flat and same all the time. The graphics could be better, physics and animations are very poor, considering the recent high quality games, NPC’s animations during conversations not exist. It is a joke! Sound FX are below average and repetitive. As Link the character can’t speak, combat is not responsive, story is too weak. Really a LAZY job. So it is a disappointment and totally below the expectations of the new gen games.",0.0

O jogo não possui algum guia ou uma maneira de se encontrar, te joga num mundo imenso e feio. Me pergunto como a mesma franquia de Dark Souls 3 e Bloodborne caiu nisso, o design desses jogos são incríveis enquanto de Elden Ring é uma poluição visual e confuso.

Everything is done right: the exploration, the gameplay, the bosses, the environments, the lore and its characters, the music... It offers a great level of challenge but beating a hard boss is very satisfying (the difficulty is also ""adjustable"" to your own liking thanks to the rune system) and when you die you know it's your fault.

It looks great but the gameplay makes you question if the fromsoft devs have been replaced by some outsourced studio.

I don't know much about the plot, and the game is difficult, but it's addictive as hell. Beautiful world, great combat and guess what, you can choose the difficulty level, which makes it easier due to the open world.

"Meu jogo favorito, Elden Ring mescla desafio, recompensa, uma experiencia de mundo aberto extremamente desafiadora e um grande sentimento de satisfação ao derrotar a Elden Beast no final. Esse jogo inova o gênero Souls, com gráficos de última geração e o tão esperado mundo aberto, atingindo, a meu ver o ""teto"", do gênero. É quase impossível de ser superado. No quesito qualidade, foi o melhor jogo lançado nos últimos 10 anos(2012-2022), e seguramente um dos 10 melhores já lançados em todos os tempos. É engraçado que, olhando cada aspecto individualmente, Elden Ring não é o melhor em quase nada: Em trilha sonora é desbancado por Dark Souls 3 e Red Dead Redemption 2, embora fique com a terceira posição, em combate está em segundo lugar, atrás apenas de Sekiro, em dificuldade está atrás de vários: Dark Souls 2, Sekiro, Black Myth Wukong, em mundo é o terceiro atrás de Skyrim e Red Dead Redemption 2, em história perde para Zelda e Red Dead Redemption 2, mas fica em terceiro, mas independentemente disso, em todas as categorias ele está entre os melhores. Portanto, eu considero Elden Ring o melhor jogo na média, pois embora não seja o melhor em quase nada(ele é o melhor em exploração e recompensa), por sempre ficar entre os 5 melhores em todas as categorias que se possa analisar(exceto gráficos, onde tem vários melhores), ele consegue se destacar como o melhor por ser pelo menos um dos 3 ou 4 melhores jogos em todos os prismas que se possa analisar.

C'est pour vous dire la puissance de ce jeu. Lorsque adulte, un jeu arrive à vous marquer de la sorte, c'est que c'est un chef d'oeuvre. En effet il est plus compliqué de surprendre, rendre curieux, impressionner, challenger, rendre accro un adulte qu'un enfant. Enfant le moindre jeu pouvait nous émerveiller. En bref Elden ring est de loin un 10/10. Les notes négatives ne viennent que de gens, incapables de surmonter la difficulté, trop peu curieux ou des fameuses personnes qui adorent penser à contre-courant et remettre en doute l'opinion publique.

"Awesome game. I don't think I need to say too much about it. What I do not like about it: Difficulty. Yes, many say this has to be but I disagree. However, after some time you tend to like some of the hard battles. For example, the fight against Malenia really makes fun and you think about making this harder for you. In the end it is all about what Level you have. So if you waste enough Lifetime farming runes, you can enter easy mode. This is not really good. Second thing I do not like is the Quest mechanics. You can easy miss something. A little bit more info would be nice. Apart from this, the game is really awesome. To me most important and best thing is the Level design. Without spoiling I just can say there is a lot to explore! To me this is clearly a must play game.",0.8

艾尔登法环》实质上是《黑暗之魂》系列的续作，重开IP的原因是为了方便丁自由的创作世界观，因此游戏在玩法上的核心机制基本都是《黑魂》的延续和拓展。除了大家熟悉的闪避、背刺、盾反，新加入的跳跃机制在本作中有着浓墨重彩的戏份，潜行机制在也十分好用。在褪色者长出膝盖后，几乎大部分的Boss都加入了攻击范围巨大的地面技能，只会滚地板的话战斗难度会大幅提升。同时本作引入了“失去平衡”的设定，R2的蓄力攻击和X+R2的跳劈能够快速积累类似《只狼》的架势条，从而触发处决，因此这几乎是所有玩家必须掌握的技巧，不过好在难度比起盾反和枪反都要低不少。跳跃机制的存在也使得大型主城的内部构造变得更加立体，玩家可以凭借屋顶和墙壁跳过大片敌人密集的区域，直接来到BOSS面前。战灰代替了以往的质变宝石，不但能够在赐福处改变武器的属性，还能够为武器绑定新的战技。战灰还能反复使用和复制，有很多类似卡利亚大剑这样帅气度和实用程度兼备的存在；法术方面，受智力影响的辉石魔法，和受信仰影响的祷告都十分强力，视觉效果的华丽程度也是空前的；四十多种灵魂能够有效降低Boss战难度，在这里也点名表扬一路随我征战的狗薪王们。如果你是一个爱看风景的不死人，一定能在交界地里大饱眼福。当我夜晚骑着灵马走在湖之利耶尼亚的原野，缓缓抬头是星辰铺满的银河，一轮皓月挂在巍峨的黄金树枝头；当电梯缓缓沉入希芙拉河的井底，地底世界的紫色星空也美到精心动魄；在孤悬在峭壁之底，似乎是罐子哥家乡的壶村，则是一派宁静美好的景象，让甚至不忍心摘走小罐罐们围着跳舞的花；盖利德原野上，红狮子城的士兵们正在与猩红腐 败滋生的怪物浴血奋战。或许正是因为开放世界给与了足够的创作空间，From Software在紧贴剧情主轴的前提下，毫不保留地展示着多年积攒的美术功底和通过环境来讲故事的能力。,1.0

This game is the most overhyped and overrated game ever released . Not only for 9th gen but for the entire history of video gaming. Wake up !!!! This game is another repetition of the previous 10 titles they released.  Worst part is, the game is deisgned to make fun of you by dying and dying again. Games suppose to be fun. this is only adding up your stress gauche as you keep playing it. poor graphics, poor story telling, poor gaming mechanics, poor story, poor sound, unfair surprise forcing you to play the god damn game all over again from the last check point you barely made up to.... And you call this challenging the gamers ??? No it is not... Literally this game should belong to gen 7 or older. no need to create false idols for our selves.

I spent most of the time figuring out where to go next then when i finally found some location i found out im not strong enough to be there and i had to start finding another location that was suited to my level. I saw many people say that open world aspect is what makes this game great and that this is how openworld should be but i dont think so. BUT when you finally find a place where you should be the game f*cking slaps the legacy dungeons are awesome as are the boss fights(although some are longer then they should be and can get annoying).TLDR: You have fun in legacy dungeons then wander aimlessly to find another one being borded to death.Game with 10/10 potential ruined by open world",0.7000000000000001

Every single enemy in the entire game is fantastic, with complicated movesets that teach you to try and try again until you're able to finish that boss. It’s rewarding every single time, no matter how many tries it takes. It always feels incredible to defeat a difficult or easy boss. This game is fantastic, and the visuals are gorgeous.

Truly a masterclass for any game designer, particularly in my personal favorite category for game enjoyment: Environmental Design and Worldbuilding.

"Игры бабадзаки, всегда имели базу фанатов кричащих про хардкор, так было ещё с 1-ыми дсами и демон соулсами, когда будучи ещё пиздюком в школе мой друг рассказывал про хардконость этих игр и говорил, что только пройдя их ты станешь настоящим хардкорщиком, я прошёл игру полностью и прохожу длс, но меня не покидает ощущение вкуса дерьма у меня во рту, а вот с этого момента начну подробнее.Конкретно Элден Ринг имеет устаревшую до ужаса боёвку из мезозойской эры, где БАЗОВЫМИ механиками  игры является апостол перекат и проповедник лёгкой тычки, где баланс всех боссов, строится на этих механиках. Более, базовых механик боевой системы в этой игре нет, а опционально добавленный прыжок зачастую не имеет смысла, пусть и добавляет некоторые возможности в бою с некоторыми боссами, но как известно - опционально, значит бесполезно и то, что большинство юзеров не будут использовать. Подобная устаревшая боёвка приводит лишь к тому, что твоё снаряжение не имеет смысла и единственное, что решает это то как ты задоджишь атаку и как нанесёшь, а сложность игры адаптивная и регулируется ещё более уёбищной механика сбора камней и прокачки уровня, для повышения урона по боссудля снижения урона по персонажу. Вся эта прокачка оружия и персонажа происходит в ебучих говно-данжах, сделанных на коленке с использование волшебной комбинации клавиш Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V в конце которых тебя будет ожидать босс (обычный моб). Пока количество базовых механик или обязательных механик, которые ты будешь развивать по мере прохождения игры не увеличится эта игра останется на уровне первого дс, Мистер Бабадзаки умеет делать хорошие игры и ярким таким примером служит Sekiro, где базовое количество механик больше, которое и добавляет разнообразия в боёвку, ведь нельзянеэффективно спамить только блокпарирование. Так вот, возвращаясь к теме хардкора, его в игре нет, для меня нет ничего сложного в тесте своей выносливости на боссах, где драки, в случае недокача происходят очень долго и где к боссу не надо подбирать ключик, а нужно просто нажимать одну кнопку вовремя. Проходя длс сейчас меня не покидает чувство того, что длс мало того, что по заполненности сильно уступает открытому миру в основной игре, так ещё и вынуждает меня исследовать мир ( Нет, не вынуждает, любой босс из длс проходится по тому же принципу, что и в обычной и можно пройти любого босса с помощью зубочистки, голым и только перекатываясь). Если ты не хочешь исследовать полупустой мир объём которого искусственно выкручен для создания красивой картинки, то боссы будут иметь абсурдно большое количество здоровьяурона по тебе, не понятно лишь то, почему если они решили частично избавиться от прошлой системы прокачки, то почему не выкрутили просто уровень персонажа в старт, где тебе бы пришлось заново качать своего перса, что было бы по мне более логичным решением, а не полумерой, какой нам её представили для того, чтобы этот не обширный мир всё-таки исследовали. Это были далеко не все мои претензии к Элден Ринг и его длс, но они просто задевают основные вещи, которые в этой игре сделаны заметно хуже. Несмотря на всё, я прошёл эту игру и оказавшись она полным калом, я бы никогда не тратил бы в ней время, у этой игры есть свои плюсы, но я хочу, чтобы главный амбассадор игр подобного жанра не стоял на месте, а развивался, поэтому призываю и остальных думать и говорить о вещах, которые позволят улучшить вами любимую игру",0.5

I was immediately hooked. The world was so beautiful and the game as a whole looked amazing. The combat is so smooth. There are so many playstyles, you can really make the game your own. The story was captivating and interesting despite being slightly hard to follow and understand at times. The side content and NPC quests are so fun. There are no quest markers or directions on where to go for the most part which is the one thing that usually bothers me with FromSoft games but I actually didn’t mind it. It almost adds to the openness and freedom that the game gives you, as if you’re really on that adventure. There is tons of replayability and so many different ways to play the game. The bosses are fun and unique, their fights never get old. Honestly one of the best games I’ve played recently and probably one of the best games of all time.

"Uno de los mejores juegos de la historia sin dudarlo, lo que es el combate es excepcional y la gran variedad de builds que nos ofrece el juego para cualquier tipo de jugador y objetivo haciendo el juego más dinámico y divertido dando así una gran re jugabilidad aparte de que las armas que hay tienen un diseño y habilidades increíbles bueno y ni hablar de las armaduras que son otra locura pero tampoco nos quedamos atrás con variedad de hechizos que literalmente hay hechizos para cualquier elemento y hay una variedad increíble. El mapa de elden ring ofrece una gran exploración sin límites solo el límite lo pones tú porque cualquier cosa que veas puedes llegar y además de que no te diga donde hay que ir ni que hayan marcadores hacen el juego mucho mejor, porque realmente estás jugando y enterándote de lo que tienes que hacer no solo siguiendo puntos en el mapa como un robot sin cuestionar las posibilidades que hay para llegar a x sitio. Ahora lo malo no tan malo, los controles del juego son pésimos aunque te termines acostumbrando es muy mala la elección de botones con el mando y ni hablar de la cámara que es peor aún, por eso recomiendo que con los bosses grandes no uses fijación de cámara porque te mareas, lo otro malo es que no exista un códice donde puedas ver a todos los enemigos y bosses que hay con una pequeña descripción e historia como una especia de libro y lo otro es la historia que a pesar de que la puedes conocer en youtube la mayor parte de la historia está basada en teorías que hace el jugador, una historia sin terminar pero eso lo hace mal juego?

"As a man who enjoys soulsborne games and the soulslike genre as a whole, to those with ratings of 0 and complain that it needs a difficulty option or that you die too much, need to sink hours into the game etc. Just. Get. Better! Really I do mean it! If your weapon does no damage, check to see if it’s even upgraded! You want to try out a weapon? Upgrade it! Or use it in another play-through! Finding a boss difficult? It’s fine if you watch videos on what it does, there’s a reason why you’re able to access it even if it’s your first time playing! Did too easily? Just level up vigor! (This game is pretty bad with its vigor checks, making you level vigor before you decide to level up your actual stats.)Want to do quest lines but don’t got any markers or quest logs? Just listen to the npc the first time! Don’t skip dialogue and actually listen! You’ll be fine if you do that! Complaining about graphics? That is just a genuine issue on your end, or you haven’t bothered changing the setting(if you’re a console player) to prioritise framerate, trust me it’s worth it. Encountering bugs? This game came out 2 years ago! Your favourite will also have bugs that you exploit as well so don’t blame this game for having it when all games do, it’s natural! In the end of this review, it’s an alright game. It’s not as crazy hard as many people out to be, actually most would say it’s the easiest game for newcomers to get into the soulsborne games! Welcome to the world of soulsborne! You died. Now just play, you‘ve already sold your soul. I did when I started and disliked bloodborne, replayed it and it’s my #1 souls game. Just play it.",0.8

Stealing ideas from previous FromSoftware games. Terrible balance. I have completed all the FromSoftware games and I can confidently say that Elden Ring is a terrible game that is not fun!,0.0
"Elden Ring, the much-anticipated collaboration between FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin has taken the gaming world by storm. As a long-time fan of the Soulsborne series, I approached Elden Ring with both excitement and trepidation, wondering if it could possibly live up to the monumental expectations. What I found was a game that not only met those expectations but transcended them, delivering an experience that is as profoundly moving as it is challenging.From the moment you step into the Lands Between, it’s clear that Elden Ring is a labor of love. The world is vast and meticulously crafted, with every region telling its own story through environmental details and carefully placed lore items. George R.R. Martin’s influence is palpable in the rich tapestry of history and mythology that underpins the game. The narrative unfolds in layers, encouraging players to explore and piece together the intricate puzzle of the world’s past and present. This method of storytelling, a hallmark of FromSoftware’s games, reaches new heights here, blending mystery with revelation in a way that is deeply satisfying.Elden Ring’s gameplay is a masterful evolution of the Soulsborne formula. The combat is as tight and demanding as ever, requiring precision, strategy, and adaptability. What sets Elden Ring apart is its open-world design, which offers unprecedented freedom and encourages exploration. The addition of the Spectral Steed, Torrent, transforms traversal, allowing players to cover vast distances swiftly and engage in mounted combat. This innovation adds a dynamic layer to the already rich combat system, making encounters feel fresh and **** game’s difficulty is a topic of much discussion, but it’s worth noting that Elden Ring provides a variety of tools to aid players. The summoning system, which allows for cooperative play, is more accessible than ever, and the inclusion of Spirit Ashes provides an additional layer of strategy. These elements make the game more approachable without sacrificing the core challenge that fans cherish.Visually, Elden Ring is breathtaking. The art direction is nothing short of spectacular, with each area offering distinct and unforgettable aesthetics. From the hauntingly beautiful ruins of Limgrave to the eerie majesty of the Erdtree, the game is a feast for the eyes. The attention to detail is astounding, with every nook and cranny packed with secrets waiting to be **** audio design is equally impressive. The score, composed by Yuka Kitamura and Tsukasa Saitoh, perfectly complements the game’s atmosphere, ranging from hauntingly melancholic to triumphantly epic. Sound effects are meticulously crafted, enhancing the immersion and making every action feel weighty and significant.Elden Ring offers deep character customization, allowing players to tailor their experience to their preferred playstyle. The range of available weapons, spells, and abilities is vast, providing a level of flexibility that is unmatched. The character progression system is intuitive yet deep, rewarding experimentation and thoughtful planning. This depth extends to the game’s NPCs, whose stories and quests add layers of meaning and consequence to the player’s **** narrative of Elden Ring is a dark and captivating tale of ambition, loss, and redemption. It explores themes of power, corruption, and the cyclical nature of history with a poignancy that is rare in video games. The characters you meet are complex and multifaceted, their fates intertwined with the larger narrative in ways that are often surprising and moving. The game’s ending, or rather endings, are thought-provoking and offer a sense of closure that is both satisfying and open to interpretation.Elden Ring is a triumph, a game that pushes the boundaries of what an open-world RPG can be. It seamlessly blends FromSoftware’s signature gameplay with a richly detailed world and a narrative that resonates on a deeply emotional level. The result is a game that is not only a joy to play but also a profound experience that stays with you long after the credits **** an era where many games are content to follow established formulas, Elden Ring dares to innovate, to challenge, and to inspire. It is a testament to the power of video games as an art form and a reminder of why we fell in love with gaming in the first place. Whether you are a veteran of the Soulsborne series or a newcomer to FromSoftware’s worlds, Elden Ring is a journey that you will not want to miss.",0.8999999999999999

Once you acquire a good weapon, which requires some initial effort, you tend to stick with it for the rest of the game. This is because there are only a few truly effective weapons, and upgrading a weapon is such an investment that farming materials to level up another one feels **** game features a wide variety of enemies, but unfortunately, about 70% of them share the same moveset and slow behavior, making them easy to defeat in 2-3 hits.

È incredibile come il gioco, pur essendo uno dei più lunghi che io abbia mai giocato, non mi ha mai annoiato, portandomi addirittura a completare più run per scoprirne tutti i segreti, vuoi che il level design è ben strutturato e quasi sempre stimolante( le battute finali si perdono un po’ per poi riesplodere con ancor più magnificenza nel finale), vuoi che ci sono una miriade di nemici diversi ed un numero di boss assolutamente FOLLE, Elden Ring merita a pieno titolo di essere nell’Olimpo dei videogiochi e sicuramente fra 20/30 anni si vedrà a lui come una delle colonne portanti del Gaming futuro.",1.0

"Just kind of boring and monotonous. If you've never played a souls game, or you're a souls-fanatic that can never get enough of the same formula, then you'll probably like this game a lot. Otherwise, it's essentially a uninspired repetition of the same ol' that From Software has been doing for over a decade now. The setting is the same boring, vague Euro-medieval high-fantasy world but without any actually intriguing lore or world-building; the gameplay is identical to Dark Souls except they have added the jumping and stealth mechanics of Sekiro, which is cool I guess except it's still nothing innovative. The only innovative mechanic is the horse combat and platforming  which is the best part of the game IMO. Otherwise, the new ""open-world"" really adds little to ****'re just using a horse to traverse big empty open spaces without any of the interesting characters, random encounters etc. **** open-world game like Horizon Zero, Witcher 3 etc. In conclusion, unless you literally can't get enough of the same old Souls formula, or you've never played a Souls game before, this game is kind of boring, monotonous and not engaging. The high critic rating just shows certain developers can keep releasing the same **** and the industry will applaud...I'm not hating either, Bloodborne was innovative, so was Sekiro, and yet Elden Ring is essentially a step backwards with superficial innovation.",0.6

"Elden Ring has an incredible number of fascinating locations to explore and cool enemies to fight.

The music and art direction are as beautiful and powerful as ever before. They really do most of the work to set the tone for an epic adventure with a dramatic finale. Elden Ring is more accessible than any Dark Souls game. Example #1: Stakes of Marika allow players to revive closer to the boss arenas and get back to the action quicker. Example #2: The mount in this game spawns out of thin air and moves through the open world faster than the normal movement speed. Example #3: Spirit ashes enable a variety of NPC summons to be upgraded, and they make boss fights a lot easier. Example #4: Invasions only happen when you voluntarily interact with the online summons. They do not happen randomly in the open world. Example #5: Fast travel is more convenient than before.

"Too much **** thing? Maybe. Elden Ring takes the souls formula and improves on it in some ways, but hinders it in others. The primary offender for me is making the into a vastly more open-world structure. The experience seems to lose some of the carefully curated design and structure of its predecessors. Nevertheless, the gameplay and creativity shines through, delivering one of the best experiences available for the current generation of consoles.",0.7000000000000001

If you are a Soulsbourne fan this game is definitely for you, as it combines all the best features from Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro and then added an amazing story on top that you will be completely immersed.

"Es estúpidamente largo, y no lo digo positivamente. Tiene muchísimo contenido, y si bien es cierto que mucho es opcional y podrías saltartelo si eres un jugador más centrado en lo principal como es mi caso, este juego se te va a hacer muy cuesta arriba, ya que los bosses son un abuso y estúpidamente complicados si no as con el nivel necesario (que obtienes haciendo todo el contenido secundario).

"A new standard has been set when it comes to learning curve, immersion and level design. The game is insanely difficult, but in a way that entices the player to learn in a fair way. Level design is fantastic, allowing you to view unreachable spots that challenge you to seek them out. The different biomes are designed beautifully, and bosses are freshly original in their attacking moves and how to defeat them. Really the only gripe I have with the game is that certain fighter classes clearly have an advantage; especially a magic-only build is a much harder, less fair challenge and only a small range of spells are truly useful, so that I was kind of forced not to play as a fully-fledged sorcerer because then the game is much less fun. That doesn't make the game a 9; it's just something that bothered me, but a magic fighter was still possible.",1.0

"Elden Ring. Words can’t describe how amazing this game is. On my PS4 I got a game called Sekiro. My first fromsoftware game. I was absolutely horrendous at it, but I loved it. Could never beat it. When I got my PS5, I downloaded Demon Souls remastered, super cool, but it just didn’t hook me. Never beat it. Than Elden Ring came out. I figured it would be the same, like it, **** at it, never beat **** something was very different right away. I will never forget opening that door into Limgrave for the first time. I can’t even describe it,but I truly believe it is something all gamers should experience. And I did **** at it, I died hundreds of times.(generous very well could have been thousands) but when I say I was hooked, I was hooked. I could not stop playing, exploring.. I was fully immersed into this beautiful world. Hundreds of hours later I beat it for the first time. I nearly cried. I thought that was it, would never play again, but I didn’t stop, I did NG+ and was truly amazed by how it didn’t feel repetitive, I found NEW things, areas, quests, npcs, lore… soon enough I was on another NG+ and looking at the trophies, I only needed 1 or two more trophies to Platinum. And I did. One of the most rewarding and meaningful gaming moments of my life. Since then, I’ve beaten Sekiro, Demon SoulsPS5, Dark Souls 3, and currently playing Bloodborn with intentions of play the other dark souls games after. Elden Ring completely changes my gaming genre. Souls like have become my favorite genre of game by a MILE. But nothing has come close to Elden Ring. It truly is my favorite game, and I will die on this hill of saying it is the GREATEST game of all time. I can’t recommend a game more than this.",1.0
"I was sceptical about Soulsborne games going open world, but when I got it I couldn't put it down. The best game from FromSoftware. A masterpiece!!!",1.0
"I finally broke my streak and finished my first souls game after going through 3 games starting with ""Bloodborne"", then followed by ""Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice"" and ""Elden Ring"". I stopped playing all of these games after putting a few hours into each and moved on. The main reason that kept me from continuing my journey into each of them was the fact that there's no objective marker, a deep menu explaining what I need to do or a proper story with interesting characters guiding me. The game wants you to find your way by yourself and exploring its vast world through your own pace. I've tried doing what the game wants me to do 3 times and playing it properly without any guide from the internet or any other souls player, and that, led to me uninstalling the game after every single try. That was about a year ago. One day, after watching a video about a souls player playing Elden Ring and explaining the story and the mechanics of the game while playing it, the thought of playing Elden Ring came to my head again. But this time, I was going to get help from outside sources and watch guides on how to actually beat the game. That was a tremendous help and boosted my motivation. I'm gonna start with the negatives. After putting 90 hours, I finally platinumed the game and beat it. And with all that, I think that this has to be most Over-Rated game of all time with a metascore of 96. The game doesn't explain it's story at all and wants you to find out about it though it's item description and environmental story telling, which I feel extremely overwhelming for new players especially for it's massive open-world. I know that most souls games are exactly like this and a lot of people enjoy this type of story telling, but I do not like it to be honest. Even after watching videos on the story and lore of the game, I still find it extremely disappointing. If there was a good story, with great side characters motivating you to push through the game, It would have been 10 times more enjoyable, but Elden Ring lacks in that part. Even the game lacks great boss fights which is the main reason you get exciting about beating the game in the first place. None of the fights except for the early boss fights feel fair. They all have delayed combo attacks with AoE that one shots you even with the most powerful builds and stats, and it forces you to use summons and changing your build for most of it's the prime bosses. The game gives you so many items to use but you are only gonna use a few of them at the time depending on your build and this, completely removes the enjoyment of exploring dungeons and camps since you are gonna end up with items you're not gonna use and small amount of runes. Speaking of dungeons, FromSoftware did a great job of copy pasting 4-5 designed layouts and randomizing them with random copy-pasted bosses and calling it a day. And, so many people are praising it for being unique when it comes to open-world games. There's so much to talk about when it comes to discussing the gameplay aspect of Elden Ring and I can't include all of that in my short review of this game. After reading all these, you're gonna say, So why did you gave it an 8/10 ???. Lemme tell you: The world design, The art-syle and music!!! Even the enemy designs. It's so good that you can't give the game a low score even tho it has a lot of serious problems. With all that, I'm gonna say that I'm gonna try more souls games and continue my journey with them from the experience I got from playing Elden Ring.",0.8

"Absolutely! Here's a seamless and concise summary of your review:Elden Ring shines as 2022's gaming masterpiece, captivating with its revival of deep, exploratory joy and offering over 80 magical hours of gameplay that every PS5 and XBOX X owner should experience. As my introduction to the Souls-like genre, the game presented a fresh challenge with its unique gameplay mechanics and priority settings, deeply immersing me into Miyazaki's intricately crafted world. The plot, shrouded in mystery and complexity, demanded external resources for a fuller understanding, reflecting the game's depth and aligning with genre expectations. The steep learning curve, especially in mastering controls, not only heightened the sense of achievement but also solidified my engagement with the game. Elden Ring's open world, a new feature for the series, offered an unparalleled sense of freedom and exploration, sparking curiosity and discovery at every turn, much like the exploratory joy found in Minecraft. The graphics, with options for native 4K at 30fps or 2K at 60fps, were breathtaking, allowing me to tailor my experience between visual fidelity and performance without sacrificing the game's stunning visuals. The musical score seamlessly enhanced the gameplay, with the memorable main theme evoking a deep emotional connection and driving my progression. Despite spending over 85 hours in the game, the lore remained enigmatic, revealing its true depth only through dedicated research and adding to the game's mystique and replayability. While the intricate controls and dense lore posed challenges, they contributed to the game's charm, making any perceived flaws negligible. As my first foray into this genre, Elden Ring set a high bar, leaving me with little to criticize and much to admire, embodying a true gaming masterpiece that challenges and delights in equal measure.",0.8999999999999999

"Horrible user experience. Good games introduce you to gameplay and mechanics slowly and step-by-step in the first couple of hours. Take Zelda as an example: It never feels overwhelming, you always have the feeling that you understand how your current set of capabilites and tools work and where you have to go and what to do next, even though it's an open world and basically a sand box game. Elden Ring however: Basic introduction for 5 minutes, then you are thrown into the world, you have to run past or skip the first couple of bosses you encounter, you have to be at certain times of the day to trigger important events that unlock essential gameplay mechanics and character capabilities ... It's really a mess. Plus the way too poetic story telling that just leaves you with only a notion of what is going on. From my perspective (46 year old gaming veteran since Commodore 64 times), this is one of if not the worst onboarding in a game. To be honest, it's my first souls-like and without the open world approach it might have been working a bit better, but it's just not fun at all to watch hours and hours of YouTube videos to know what you have to do. It ****. Sound/music is good, but no controller rumble, clunky character movement, basically running/riding aroudn all day long, levelling up your character and weapons, trying encounters, failing, leveling up again, trying again ...

"Elden Ring is a good game, but the open world came at the cost of rewarding, tight level design that the other Souls areas had. It says a lot that my favorite areas of this game are the ""dungeon""-esque zones. The open world areas are pretty, but you'll spend most of your time in them sprinting past all the enemies and empty space. Weapon variety is disappointing, especially for the boss weapons. A majority of the bosses are reskins and forgettable, and all the ganks are poorly designed. There were a few bosses I enjoyed, but overall I think I would have enjoyed ER more if they focused less on the open world and more on tight level design and boss quality.",0.7000000000000001

"Elden Ring è una vera e propria ventata d'aria fresca nel panorama souls ma videoludico in generale.

Il riutilizzo di assetts criticato da molti imbecilli senza una benché minima conoscenza della difficoltà di sviluppare un gioco così ENORME in realtà è usata in maniera intelligente. L'unica pecca è la presenza di un paio di miniboss/nemici sbilanciati e senza senso e problemi di bilanciamento (tutti risolti con patch successive), ma ciò non ha inficiato in uno dei migliori videogiochi mai creati nella storia.

After waiting for years for its release and getting all trophies of the game i can easily say that its one of the best open world games out there but definitely not the best FROMSOFTWARE project in my opinion. To me and possibly any other fan of the studio - it was basically Dark Souls 4. It was not as unique as Sekiro or Bloodborne but is a lot better than Dark Souls 2 and 3. Regardless - Elden Ring will forever remain as one of my favorites,0.8999999999999999
"A top 3 Soulsborne, barely beaten out by Sekiro : Shadows Die Twice and Dark Souls 1. Incredibly vast open world with degenerately hard bosses and combat so good you'll wish every RPG had it.

"I like difficult bosses, but the game keeps punishing you even when you you’re not in combat. You want story or lore? Too bad, gotta work for it. I feel like I can’t take a literal step forward in that world without needing to avoid something or fight it. I like the dark fantasy setting, I just don’t like being alone in it. you’re white-knuckling it from campfire to campfire. The game doesn’t actually encourage exploration imo. Yes, it’s a massive world and you can go anywhere.. but what’s the point if the landmarks have no narrative significance and you can’t do anything when you get there? Are you just supposed to window-shop all the bosses and enemies you can’t encounter yet?  the setting is relentlessly brutal. That’s the biggest turn-off for me. The only joy that’s allowed is the EXACT moment after you defeat a boss. As soon as that animation is over you’re thinking about the nearest bonfire location to save. If the enemies didn’t reset every time you rested I think I could handle it. Then I could feel safe in certain areas and get to explore / appreciate the setting. the gameplay loop is pain and I’m not competitive enough to feel satisfaction after I using 3 hours of my life on a single encounter. I know there’s the git gud argument and maybe these games just aren’t for me.. but I’m not convinced. I love Respawn’s Jedi games and I’m a huge Berserk fan. I love to watch gameplay of Elden Ring and I 100% support any title that releases fully-functioning and with not MTX’s - that’s part of the reason I bought it. I just thought I had a somewhat nuanced view **** that seems devoid of criticism.",0.7000000000000001

It is really fun to just play different playthroughs with different weapons and because the bosses are so well designed you can play all kinds of different ways with them.This is my favorite soul game with the Boss design because you can stance break them and make that them fun to fight against.I just love using this spiked fist weapon , so I can use bleed  and Frost at the same time on the ****'s also because it is both strong and **** the game's biggest problem is that it's a  open world where if you are going for a certain build then most of the content is useless it just kind of sad to look at all There is and just saying to yourself. I don't need any of it.This game could very easy be at 10 out of ten if the DLC gets out and become good. Just like the original Dark Soul dlcMessage Frederiks forsikring bureau",0.8

"Bland open world with added copy paste cave systems, over, unique level dungeon designs we've seen in past titles. The first boss introduced a new entrance scene, which was then taken away for the rest of the game. The game felt like it was made for Co op, yet, fog walls that block progression only to summon a second later after the wall, and lack of horses make Co op a slog. Repeated night time bosses and major story bosses repeated in small dungeons. Graces everywhere. We ended up with a game that wants to strike a balance with many different audiences and ends up dissapointing the people that have been there since demon/dark souls imo. Its a shame these nothing open worlds will continue as proven by the popularity of this game. But I would prefer to see some innovation to the series and bring it back to its roots.",0.6
"This game blends all the good elements of the various souls games into a masterpiece and also add some new mechanics, such as a jump button, a counter attack after blocking and more. The game is an open-world, wich means if you're having a hard time you can go somewhere else and return later (sometimes can make some areas very easy because of over-level; doesn't apply to the late game). The world is extremely huge, and has a lot of caves and cathacombs to explore, but a lot of bossess are reused in these places so It can feel a bit repetetive. The variaty of weapons and builds possibile is huge, you can make every weapon good with the right build. The game is very challenging as in every other soulsborne game, but the ashes system (wich are basically summons) can really help in lots of fights. The game is poorly optimized on PC and can also have some troubles on PS4 but not too overwhelming. The game defenitly deserved the game of the year.",0.8999999999999999

"This game was intimidating because I had read how this was a tough game. I had never played any of the prior games before. I found this easier to figure out than Sky Rim but I did spend more time on this game. It was tough to get the character upgraded. There were a lot of deaths but it was rewarding when you got to the point of fearlessly jumping into battle and looking for trouble. The ability to explore and do side quests was cool. I appreciated the co-op support when you got in a jam at a particular stage. It was nice to have someone watch your 6 and help you defeat a boss.

"""Elden Ring stands as an exemplary testament to the art of gaming. It masterfully encapsulates the transformative journey from humble beginnings as a lowly commoner, emerging from the mire in tattered garb to the gradual acquisition of skills and abilities that eventually culminate in the ascension to dominion over 'The Land Between.' The game achieves unparalleled immersion, facilitated by its superlative graphics and voice acting. Its expansive world exudes an eerie and haunting ambiance, creating a sense of seemingly boundless exploration. With an abundance of side quests, farming opportunities, rich lore, multifaceted characters, and intense combat, players can easily invest over a hundred hours before reaching the culmination of the main storyline. The gameplay experience is exceptional, offering a diverse array of melee combat styles that evolve in tandem with one's proficiency, resulting in sheer enjoyment.FromSoftware's ability to seamlessly fuse gratifying combat mechanics with theatrical musical scores and striking visuals is nothing short of astounding. Elden Ring is highly recommended for those yearning to be enveloped in a vast and foreboding realm ripe for salvation.""",0.8999999999999999

"Elden Ring is an excellent game (GOTY 2022) and possibly the best soulslike ever created. What i really liked after 150 hours of playing and the platinum trophy is that this game wants and succeds on treating you like a clever person and not a dumb braindead gamer who only needs 2 buttons to play a game or watch 30 hours of cinematics or depend on QTEs in combat all the time. The game demands intelligence and imagination from you, from exploration to customization and from skill and technique to fast reflexes. I mean, Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne already had these things but now they are even better. The ONLY 2 reasons that hold it back from true greatness imo (9/10 and not 10/10) are, first, the story is almost non-existent and second, the technical side in general, both in terms of graphics and music/sounds/ost, could be better. I mean, i played Hogwarts Legacy and then came back immediately to play again Elden Ring and it seemed to me like a game from 2015 or something. Nevertheless, a true must-buy for every soulslike lover or action rpg gamer in general.",1.0

"Alright, folks, let me tell you about my mind-blowing adventure with Elden Ring. This game is off-the-charts awesome, I'm giving it a solid 10/10! Seriously, it's a masterpiece that left me speechless. The world design is insane, and the combat mechanics? Oh boy, they're on a whole other level! First off, this open world is mind-blowing. It's like stepping into a fantasy dreamland. Every nook and cranny is bursting with jaw-dropping details and hidden goodies. I couldn't get enough of exploring this place. It's like a magnet, pulling you in and refusing to let **** combat is tough as nails, no doubt about it. But man, when you finally take down those enemies and bosses, the rush is unreal! You gotta be strategic, think on your feet, and time your attacks just right. But when you emerge victorious, you feel like a total **** enemy and boss designs are straight-up mind-blowing. I mean, who comes up with this stuff? FromSoftware, that's who! Each encounter is like stepping into a twisted nightmare. These baddies are creative, terrifying, and push you to the edge. But when you conquer them, oh man, it's the sweetest feeling in the world.I poured a whopping 100+ hours into this game, and guess what? Not once did I get bored. It's addicting as hell! Even after **** that platinum trophy, I dived straight into NG+3 without hesitation. I just couldn't get enough. Bottom line, if you're a fan of challenging games, Elden Ring is an absolute must-play. It's a rollercoaster ride of emotions, and the satisfaction it delivers is unmatched. The world, the combat, the boss fights — it's all next-level stuff. Elden Ring has rightfully earned its place among the all-time greats.",1.0

"As a huge FromSoftware fan it was difficult for me to keep my expectations down. Luckily Elden Ring  is possibly the best game they have released yet. Borrowing mechanics from the Souls series, Bloodborne and Sekiro while introducing new ones that allow for a more accessible experience (summons for example) means that it is the perfect entry point for newcomers. The open world was my biggest worry as I feared that FromSoft would lose some of their signature detail and world building, again I was proven wrong as the world of Elden Ring is not just vast but also deep, literally and figuratively. Yes it is difficult but that comes with the territory. I eagerly await the likely dlc.",1.0
"I played this game in early 2023, and it was my first FromSoftware game. I really enjoyed the main story, although I had to watch a lot of videos to fully grasp it. Nevertheless, I appreciated the storytelling approach. The main bosses were all enjoyable to fight and had unique characteristics. The combat, while involving a lot of dodging and waiting for ripostes, still managed to maintain a distinct feel, although it could become somewhat repetitive at **** game's world is visually stunning, and despite the graphics not being top-notch, I found the art style to be quite appealing. My primary criticism pertains to the repeated use of bosses in the dungeons. I understand the need to populate the world, preventing it from feeling empty, and I'm pretty sure no one has discovered all the dungeons on their first playthrough. However, I encountered a significant number of identical bosses, even within the main campaign.Overall, it's a good game, especially if you're a fan of FromSoftware's previous works, and it also serves as a solid introduction if you're new to their games, as was the case in my experience.",0.8

"Es bueno pero para mí está algo sobrevalorado, está bien la libertad que da para explorar pero este juego va al extremo y no te dice casi nada sobre su hulistoriany mundo, a veces se agradece que un juego te presente su historia y lore de un modo más tradicional, creo que se pierde mucho así y se pierde gran parte del trabajo de los desarrolladores y de George Martin.",0.7000000000000001

"I have been a fan of FromSoftwares Soulsbourne games for a comparatively short time, around 5-6 years. This being said Elden Ring blew it out of the park for me. There was a great deal of hype surrounding its release, I don't know why but it just didn't seem interesting to me. When I gave it a shot I was addicted. I sat in my tiny dorm room transported to a wonderfully dark and interesting world that I was entirely not ready for. As I sing praises for this game there is something criminal that plagues it. A certain area you are transported to near the end of the game contains three bosses ""which I know of"". One of them (technically two) is the worst boss in the game, relying on unfair mechanics to punish solo players and people who do not use tear summons. The other two are incredibly hard, but also incredibly fun. However, I have noticed as I reached around NG+7 that the first and last boss have become devoid of meaning, only existing to haunt my desire to get back onto the game. The second boss within the area is a hidden gem though, quite literally. This area and the boss that redates it are the only reasons this game isn't a 10/10 though. I highly recommend you play this game.",0.8999999999999999
"The game is perfect for me. It is so big, so great and so beautiful. Some things become repetitive (dungeons, mobs) but the main dungeons (with shard keepers) are really great. Also, you can just rush the story if you want but I did ALL activities because the game is great. Also, the platinum is native and doesn't require 100 NG+. I will definitely replay it in the future.",1.0

The would feels lazily made with many rehash enemies and bosses from previous areas in this game and other From Soft games.

"This game is wasting money and wasting time. Worst game in my 40 years of life i've ever played. There is no explanation from the developers how to play the game. no explanation of what is going on. You spawn in the world, read some notes, empty world, you meet extremely strong npc's who kill you instantly. It is impossible to play this game. Unfortunately I bought this game on Playstation and Sony operates the rudest customer policy out there. Sony doesn't refund customers even if you've only played for an hour. A return via Steam on PC is possible as soon as you have played it for less than 2 hours. Thank you Sony Playstation &amp; Elder Ring for giving me such a terrible piece of sh** experience. Next time I'll think twice before buying a game from the PS store. Unfortunately, I already bought a PS5. I should have known all this before...",0.1
"After playing Dark Souls 1,2 and 3, Eldenring is the cherry on top. The first playthrough is breathtaking, the level design often amazed me in between. You dive deep into a mystical game world that is very addictive. The story is wrapped up in a soul typical way, you have to search for it, which is good, it's more realistic than 20h video sequences. The game is challenging, if you understand it this challenge is very fun and rewarding. The music is perfectly tuned and immersive. This game is a masterpiece. 160h so far, thanks for the experience. For the insecure, play it for at least 20 hours and it will grab you and not let go until you finish it!",1.0

"the game is fun but I really just came here to talk about the low reviews. Some of the low reviews have very valid points. But a lot of low reviewers want their hand held, others are just dumb. What's that you say? No quest's you say? no story you say? I suppose your right, the game does not have a mini map telling you exactly where all of your side quest's are, or a submenu under the mini map telling you exactly what it is your supposed to do for the side quest. Why is that? Because the game is challenging you to figure it tf out. Use those few brain cells of yours to play the game, after all you have to be able to read to get the story in this game. There is a story being told not directly but environmentally and within literally every item in the game. Also if the game is too hard for you I don't think that's a valid criticism, I beat the game (no im not the only one who has beaten the game) and lo and behold its not that hard. The game definitely challenges you at times, but there seems to be quite a few gamers out there who have never heard of a challenge. I love the variety of different builds, I love the combat, I love the world they have built. All in all a great game and am hyped for dlc!",1.0

Music is fantastic. Gameplay smooth. And open world is very immersive and you can easily lost hundreds hours in it. Anyway this is masterpiece!",1.0

"Доволі overrated, як на мене. При зачистці всіх однотипних нудних дандженів (а як можна очікувати іншого від людей, які грали в соулси), боси тривіалізуються просто до рівня кежуал (навіть без спіріт саммонів, з ними це просто імба). Зрозуміло що це робить тайтл більш accessible для загалу й відповідно він принесе більше кеша, але все ж тоді варто зберегти якийсь баланс для досвідчених соулс-геймерів, інакше просто виходить класична ґрайнд-бігалка і вся магія соулсборну помирає в зародку. Не варто було й Мартіну віддавати лор, те в чому Міядзакі і команда завжди були дуже сильні. Тепер замість Неймлес Кінга, Лорда Ґвіна, Лотріка, Орфана й інших феноменальних босів, отримали 5 версій Ґодфрі, Ґодріка, Ґідеона, Марґіта, Морґота, Ранні, Рінні, Ренні, Мезим й купу інших імен згенерованих рандомайзером (як власне Мартін завжди робить для свого фентезі і не приховує цього). Істинно гру року варто було віддавати Богу. Єдине, що дійсно заслуговує поваги в цьому тайтлі це левел дизайн (лише не дандженів), те що в білд світу вкладено тони годин кранчів дуже і дуже помітно, але на жаль цього не достатньо, щоб бути досконалою грою.",0.6

"Hard to put down why this game was so good for me. Suffice to say I usually manage one play through of the best single player games, but for Elden Ring I ended up doing 5 runs across 4 character classes across about 250 hours. A key part of it is the fairness of the game. You could, if you were good enough, complete the game without levelling your character at all. There's only one difficulty setting, which I love as It really creates a sense of community with other players. Similarly there are no random loot drops or similar, instead every weapon and every character is exactly where the game designers intended. It is hard, particularly at the outset whilst you figure things out, but that is seriously mitigated by the open world design - if you can't beat a boss or area there will be an area where your skill level matches the enemies where you can level up. But crucially all of the content is so consistently good that this doesn't feel like grinding but exploring and making your character stronger. And the reward for stretching yourself is real with powerful items stashed away in the areas you are scared to tread. The combat mechanics have a beautiful and brutal precision. I saw one reviewer desribe later boss battles like a dance and that feels right. I had a misspent youth in various Muay Thai and boxing gyms and this style of combat appeals to me so much more than the button smooshing, mob exploding experience of some games. I would fall asleep at night with my mind racing through how to improve my build with a very fair and interesting system. The story is opaque and strange, more of a imprint of past events which you uncover fragments of as you explore. You can play without multiplayer entirely and the game will be wonderful but when you do start using it there is a subtle but genuine sense of shared joy in the movements and actions of fellow players. There are no microtransactions. You feel as if the content and experience are utterly paramount to the game designers and producers. In a world where the board room permeates the texture of so many games the sheer authenticity and purity of Elden Ring is an absolute joy.",1.0

This is easily one of the best open world games ever made! After playing Red Dead Redemption 2 i was left pretty disappointed by open world games for a long time. Then Elden Ring came out and the rest is history. One of the best settings and gameplay in any open world game ever! The environments are just full of character and the locations are some of the most unique in any video game ever. There are endless builds you can use.

"A very fun souls game set in the open world area of the lands between. There is a lot of content in this amazing game including a 36 side questlines 6 known endings and a large variety of bosses, landscapes and weapons. My main issue with this game is that it wasn't longer as if you don't do any optional content the game is very short with only a few mandatory bosses, but i think this is balanced out by the increasing level of the bosses which requires you to do a little bit of exploration and grinding. Also exploration is awarded by weapons, lore and more content. There is also arguments saying that the game of the year is undeserved but i disagree with this statement as even though i agree that god of war: Ragnarök was amazing, elden ring surpassed in combat, exploration and storytelling.",0.8999999999999999

The adrenaline you get from the fights is so weird feeling, and after some Boss-fights my heart was thumping so hard and I was shaking so much I thought I was going to die, which was a strangely fun and felt especially rewarding after the 30 or so attempts it took to kill Radahn, but it still has a few ""small"" issues like re-using bosses, I didn't mind but I can see why that would be annoying to some.

"My reviews are always based on fun and I did like the game but it is very confusing and very big. It is a massive open-world souls game with a lot of ways to play but you have to grind a lot to level up and there is virtually zero direction. The game runs well and is beautiful on PS5, loading times are almost zero it loads really quickly. However, I felt totally lost after a couple of hours but continued exploring, grinding, rinse, and repeat.  Eventually, I managed to get to the Academy after 40 hours but I spent almost double the hours trying to kill ""Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon"". There is only so much a person can take doing the same thing over and over again and getting zero results. This game is not as much fun as I had hoped as all your doing is the same rinse and repeat which becomes tedious. If you want a game that doesn't overwhelm you try Bloodborne.",0.7000000000000001

"Elden Ring is the antithesis of the bloated, over produced, unimaginative side quest stuffed open world game that has become so popular. It feels like a true adventure - you against the world. It’s hard but you’re free to seek easier areas of the game and come back to harder parts later. Over 100 hours in and I am still at the edge of my seat. The intensity of combat when you are right at the edge of your skill level is really something. Adrenaline pumping. Yes sometimes is can be frustrating so it best suits individuals with a persistent attitude and a desire to overcome difficult challenges. It’s probably not for everyone but it has been a great experience for me personally. I love this game.

"The user scores for this game are a **** joke. All of the 0s here are from angry gamers that walked in expecting a watered-down open world with forgettable, one-dimensional plot points and characters and simple cut and dry storytelling. This game is not that. If you’ve played any of the dark souls, you know a little bit of what to expect. The lore/story is never explained directly; instead the enemies and NPCs you encounter all contain a little of the narrative, like little story biscuits that you have to digest in your own way, and absorb the overall narrative through item descriptions and short exposé. It’s a different method of game design to be sure, but just because your brain is too small to appreciate it doesn’t mean it’s bad. Not every game has to be AC Valhalla or Far Cry 5. The combat is brutal, sure, but that’s the point. You have to find a way to overcome challenging enemies. The world is varied and absolutely massive to explore, sometimes the long cave with the vicious mini-boss doesn’t yield worthwhile loot, but the real loot is the triumph itself. This experience isn’t exactly for everybody, but to say that it’s a 0/10 is extremely dishonest. Even if it’s not your cup of tea, it has to be at least a 5.",0.8999999999999999

"Didn't like it. I don't understand how this game got as much hype as it did. I've been playing open-world games for over a couple decades so I can tell you that this game isn't what it boldly makes itself out to be. Don't let the visuals fool you. The graphics are great - it's visually stunning yes but that's its only appeal. The overall gameplay is underwhelming and unimaginative and dull  - the open world is bland and soulless. No distinction between NPC behavior. All NPCs you encounter seem to share the same hostile AI. The bosses are ridiculously overpowered from the start which makes combat in the game feel unbalanced. There are no quests and no clear objectives. You basically roam around aimlessly and get into frequent random fights. There seems to be a bit of bias with all the positive reviews as they most likely come from hardcore, devoted fans of the franchise. This feels more like an unpolished beta rather than a finished fleshed-out game. It would be an insult to compare this game to titles like Skyrim and the Witcher. Final verdict - The Elden ring is shallow and overrated. If you're looking for rich and engaging gameplay, I don't recommend.",0.2
"Absolutely amazing game. The graphics are nice, the gameplay, the difficulty, the consistency. Some of these negative reviews are so stupid. You se people saying that well ""Oh the game is too hard 0/10"" Well then shame on you for spending your money on a game you obviously researched nothing about! Also people will complain **** changes it up too much and is inconsistent then when they find a consistent game say the exact opposite. Also people who seem to obviously not know this is soulsborne due to doing absolutely no research pick on it for primary features of soulsbornes. People are mad that the game isn't insanely linear and just assume there is absolutely no story instead of actually putting in the effort to uncover it. Again, people complain that it's hard. People say that the game is empty which doesn't make sense because there are enemies and dungeons everywhere. I guess they are just mad that it's not like the mainstream games where it's brimming with random NPCs instead of brimming with challenges. I also see people call the graphics awful and I'm like ""Are you sure you're reviewing the right game?"" People will also say this game is a ripoff of the previous soulsgames. That's the whole damn point. Elden Ring was created to perfect the souls formula not recreate it. People also say this is a downgrade which is strange considering I quite clearly recall the Demon Souls, the progenitor of the souls formula to be the first of it's kind. But mostly it's just because of people raging because of a skill issue. Another thing is this game isn't for casuals. Fromsoftware will NEVER add a difficulty system because the whole point is to get good as a gamer. YOU should've been aware of that before you decided to play this game. The idea is that no matter how good you are they want you to get good at the game. To grow. That is the purpose of Soulsbornes. To grow as a gamer.

"Elden Ring is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best game I’ve played in LONG time. The last time I was this obsessed with a game was Breath of the Wild. Elden Ring has perfected the somewhat challenging aspect of an open world RPG. Many times the world can be huge but with very little to do throughout it. That is absolutely not the case here. Every single step of the way is filled with something. Wether it be an epic item, a new area with cool lore, or an insane boss battle, this game is PACKED with content. It took me about 85 hours to complete the game on my first run so yes, there is plenty to do. Another thing that some open world games have trouble with is story. They can focus so much on the gameplay ****, which isn’t bad, that they completely overlook making a good story to go with it. That is simply NOT the case with Elden Ring. While the story is in no way super obvious when you first play, just by playing it again or even watching a YouTube video, it’s easy to see how much story and lore is there. The base story is great but where it really hits home is the side stories. There are so many side quests each with their own story and lore. As you play through and see all these deep and emotional stories intertwine and unfold, it really changes your perspective on the entire game. Not to mention they’re just plain epic.    Now the highlight of this game for is the bosses. With near countless bosses and dungeons/mini dungeons, you will constantly be saying “Oh my gosh what’s that?!” and “Holy cow this thing is awesome!!” as you fight through countless baddies. But of course what good are awesome bosses without a great way to fight them? That brings me to my next highlight, “PLAY STYLES!!” There are so many different ways to play this game. You can play as a simple swordsman who wants to restore peace to the Lands Between, a Sorcerer who seems to slay all evil, or even a Samurai bent on bringing world domination. By leveling up various attributes you can use specific weapons and creat the character of your dreams. With hundreds of swords, sorceries, and spells, skies the limit with what you can do. I for example just made a lighting based swordsman and it looks freaking epic. This also adds a TON of replay ability. You can start simple, using only swords and bows, and then on your next playthrough you can switch to magic. It will never get old.      I’m conclusion, Elden Ring is a MASSIVE game that will keep you engaged for countless hours and captivate your heart in a matter of minutes. If you’ve never played a game from “Fromsoftwear” this is a great place to start. Is it hard? Absolutely. Does that also make you feel epic when you achieve something? Absolutely. And is this also the game of the year for a reason? Absolutely.  The game encourages you to never give up and strive to be stronger. I HIGHLY recommend this game if you’ve never played it. And if you have, go play it again. It deserves it.",1.0
"Elden ring supo como combinar la fórmula souls pero ahora en una experiencia de mundo abierto. El juego a diferencia de otros juegos de ""mundo abierto"" cuyo nivel de exploración es mínimo ya que el recorrido es en línea recta y no te la la libertad de explorar con libertad el mapa en elden ring no es así, no sólo el juego te deja ir por donde quieras, tambien hay recompensas por explorar motivando al jugador a seguir recorriendo el mundo, aunque el sistema de combate no es nada innovador y la mayoria de sus mecanicas son recicladas de los juegos anteriores como seria la mecanica de sigilo y los habilidad de saltar de sekiro, el frenetismo y las mazmorras de bloodborne y el sistema de combate de dark souls 3. Al principio sólo quería seguir explorando ya que era muy divertido, no obstante el juego recicla enemigos y jefes haciendo que muchos combates de jefes no se sientan tan memorables y a veces haciendolos monótonos. Tambien tuvo problemas en su salida a pc ya que muchas personas no pudieron disfrutarlo por estar mal optimizado, aunque es verdad que ya lo arreglaron y actualmente se puede jugar muy bien en pc, no deja de ser un error que tuvo en su salida. Mi conclusión de elden ring sería que es un mundo abierto ambicioso que buscaba ser lo más grande y lleno posible, pero acabo siendo un juego que le sobran muchas horas debido a lo repetitivo que se vuelve a medida que avanzas en el juego. Aunque no cabe duda que dentro de unos años muchas compañías de videojuegos intentarán copiar el éxito de elden ring en un intento de lograr lo que este consiguió. Lo que demuestra la influencia que tendrá de unos años. El juego está lejos de ser perfecto pero aún así lo recomiendo bastante tanto para fans de la saga como jugadores novatos.",0.8

"After buying this well-known and apparently great game – I mean, all of those awards – The question that keeps popping in my mind is: “How could I fall for this marketing scam?” It’s even sad, really. I tried to play for 1 hour but it felt awful from the very first minute. The outdated graphics makes you feel like throwing up and feeling like it's 2001 once again. The storytelling is pointless – Is there any story at all!? Can someone explain this to me!? – and the gameplay it’s not that big of a deal, let's face it. After spending a considerable amount of money (with discount, even!) with this “Marketing Scam” as I am calling it now, I am going to pay more attention to what the general audience is saying about a game, other than just look at the awards shows.

I wanted to love this game so much but once I reached the endgame I couldn't bring myself to play it any longer. while there are many things I love about the game I had become so bored of the repetitive bosses and enemies that I couldn't enjoy the game any longer. I was not under leveled nor did I have a crap build I just could not play it any longer I wished i loved the game but truthfully I can not even play it  the bosses became so bad and just borderline unfair that even after taking breaks i could no longer progress.

"Genuinely one of the most memorable gaming experiences of my life. The environmental storytelling, combined with the  atmospheric world building and refined combat system just makes ma want to erase my brain and discover all of its facets all over again. The epic bosses are the icing on the cake. Mechanically challenging and accompanied by one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in gaming.  Not all of them live up to the standards of the better ones, but still have something unique going for them. Even if it's just a new combination of already learned mechanics. I never finished a souls game before and I liked this one so much, that I'm almost through Dark Souls 3 already and about to buy the Demon's Souls Remaster. 10/10 – we need more games like this, and less of uninspired, soulless (pun intended) products such as Call of Duty, Fifa or anything Ubisoft.",1.0

"It's a very delayed review because my monitor broke, but I see that fanboys and those who write reviews with money have raised this fiasco game to the level of unrivaled. Anyway, let's move on to our real unbiased review. Let's start with the mechanics as always, there is no innovation in mechanics, standard soul games, jumping is added and has almost no effect on the game. Open world was added to the game, but mechanically is there such a thing, the answer is no. The game is very big, there are incredibly many castles and dungeons you can visit, but they are all flat and empty inside. Let's start with the castles, when you start the game, you look around and see the incredible map and you start exploring, traveling and wandering around in castles that last a maximum of half an hour, yes, you did not hear wrong, the time you spend in castles is half an hour, including Lyndell! All of those incredibly designed castles are just images, empty castles with no design inside, filled with creatures and left. When I look at the old souls games, designs like DS 1 Anor Londo, DS 2 Drangleic castle are bigger and more detailed than all the castles in the Elden ring game combined. Ds 2 had this success despite being a half-open world, Elden ring is a huge empty world full of creatures. The only good thing about it is that it looks great artistically. I have explained the chapter and map designs together with the mechanics. Now let's look at the small innovations and whether they have an effect on the game. Let's start with the mount, we have a horse-like mount in the game, this mount allows us to travel around the whole world, we can do combat and boss fights in some places and it has no mechanical effect on the game. The things we do with the mount are very limited, don't expect something like Zelda or Shadow of the colossus. When I say Shadow of the colossus, they said that they were inspired by Shadow of the colossus before the game came out, there is nothing about it in the game. Since jumping was added, the platform was expected, which it should have been, but they didn't put it, the jumping mechanics look ridiculous even next to the games 30 years ago. Let's talk about dungeons, there are dungeon designs that are so terrible that they compete with Skyrim. You enter hundreds of dungeons throughout the game and except for a few, they are all similar designs. We have come to the end of our review and unfortunately Elden ring is not a good game at all. The same mechanics, open world game mechanics and design are not reflected in the game, nothing good except for the improved spells. Elden ring is the biggest fiasco of this year. 57/100 if we come to the score",0.5

Weapons, summons, Co op and character creation have vast options. The game is so much fun, the story is top tier cuz I'm also crafting it as I progress and get stronger. The freedom to do what you want and how to do things is a great feeling. The epic boss battles, surprises at every corner and the difficulty of every challenge and when you clear it. It feels so rewarding. Elden ring is amazing! I cleared it after 200 hrs. It is very long for those that want to do everything but it is up to the player how long they want to take to finish the game and of you don't. Then that's where it ends. You die and become a tarnished that failed. Like the npc that went hollow in dark souls. They became a hollow and gave in to it, roaming the land in a madness state. So in a way. That was your story. You failed to become elden lord.",0.5

"I think it is a very good game but apperently it is not for everyones preferences because of its desing choises. Its biggest flaw is that the game is so perfectly unbalanced in scale of combat you can clearly see this is a designing choise. This is a modern game with 90s NES game difficulty. On the other hand, the best thing about this game is that it brings different perspective to open world design which makes you feel completelty free to do anything in an incredible fantasy world.  So I say this game is all about gamer preferences and nothing about critics and reviews.",1.0

That being said I feel like the game has some obvious issues that hinder it from receiving the perfect score, like the bosses being a bit underwhelming or the balancing of the weapons being pretty bad to the point where you either have to give in and use a summon or play with the meta weapons which is so unlike the other fromsoft games.

"This game is definitely awesome, but has many flaws that ruin it. The boss fights are next level, the soundtrack is incredible, and the art style/ atmosphere really is a sight to behold. Even though these things are great there are tons of issues. The content in the world is copy pasted with not that much liveliness to it, (excluding the occasional dungeon in regards to copy and pasted). The world just feels dead overall. The issues with the framerate on  the current gen consoles is also frustrating. As for mechanics of the game there is nothing that makes it feel like it has been perfected or gotten better in any way. The combat and movement is still pretty clunky and janky. The tutorials are not helpful enough especially for players who are newcomers to the ""Souls"" type series. The menu and crafting system, and item use can be confusing as far as what the items do and what the purpose is. Compared to Sekiro's combat it feels like it is missing something. Also, sadly a lot of the same combat animations are used from Dark Souls 3. It just feels like the 10/10 ratings are all hype. I would say it is more likely in the 6/10 - 7/10 range. Although, that is just my opinion. The game just feels the exact same as all of the older FromSoftware titles including the older ones. If it is not broke don't fix it I guess, but there needs to be exciting new features and mechanics added.",0.7000000000000001

"This game is essentially a boring and repetitive version of Dark Souls with some changes to item names. I bought this as I did actually like Dark Souls 3, but Elden Ring just feels and runs like crappy PS3 game, seriously, my PS5 couldn’t even manage a stable 120FPS, at that stage, I returned it and bought another copy of Dark Souls 3. Another aspect I hate is the easiness, for the love of god, the only reason I remotely enjoy this is for the challenge, and when I have ghosts essentially fighting for me, it’s no good. The art design is only sometimes nice, other than that it feels like a muddy, brown world with a thin line of paint. I cannot even believe how some people think this might even have a slim chance of winning Game Of The Year, truly a terrible year for gaming as a whole.",0.0
"Vorab möchte ich sagen, dass ich Elden Ring nicht schlecht finde. Wenn ich aber ehrlich zu mir selbst bin, ist das für mich die Enttäuschung des Jahres und ich würde am liebsten weniger Punkte vergeben. Objektiv betrachtet macht das Spiel aber auch einige Sachen richtig und das möchte ich nicht zu extrem bestrafen. Ich würde, trotz das ich großer Fan von Bloodborne, Ds3 oder Sekiro bin nicht sagen, dass meine Erwartungen zu hoch waren. Ich habe mich zwar grundsätzlich auf den Titel gefreut, wirklich gehyped war ich nicht. Ja, Eldenring bringt ähnlich wie Zelda BotW oder Ghost of Tushima einen frischen Wind in das Open World Gerne. Jedoch ist man hier irgendwo auch über das Ziel hinausgeschossen. Ingesamt stören mich 6 Themen sehr. 1. Die Open World selbst: So toll der Ansatz der Freien Wahl und Erkundung ist, sie ist lange nicht so gut gemacht wie es oft dargestellt wird. Die ganze Welt macht einen trüben und leblosen Eindruck, nicht zuletzt wegen der schlechten Technik. Die Welt soll ja verlassen und trostlos sein, aber sie fühlt sich trotzdem nicht lebendig an. Zelda BotW hat dieses Problem deutlich besser gelöst. Da waren auch nur ganz wenige NPCs über die Welt verstreut und einige große Städte, trotzdem war ein großer Teil der Welt leer, sie hat sich aber nie so angefühlt. Zum großen Teil ist hier auch das Sounddesign bei Zelda dafür verantwortlich, dass nie solch ein negatives Gefühl zustande kommt (und nein ich meine nicht die Musik). Alles in Elden Ring fühlt sich tot an. Hinzukommt, dass ich mir immer mega umständlich einen Weg suchen muss, anders als bei Zelda. Wenn ich in Zelda einen interessanten Ort sehe, kann ich da einfach hin und durch einige Tricks dir Ausdauer beim klettern regenerieren. Dadurch fühlt sich diese Freiheit gar nicht so frei an. 2. Die Seelenasche: Die Darksouls Reihe hat einem immer wunderbar beigebracht am Ball zu bleiben und die Mechaniken und die Gegner zu studieren. Man wusste immer wenn man gestorben ist, dass man selber dafür verantwortlich ist. Die Seelenasche nimmt das aber zum großen Teil. Außer der Mana Anzeige gibt es kein Limit durch andere Attribute, weshalb das für mich eine zusätzliche Mechanik ist. Eine Mechanik die aber dafür sorgt, dass wen ich bei einem Boss sterbe das Gefühl habe, nicht effektiv genug gekämpft zu haben. Ja irgendwo ist es eigenes Versagen, aber zum anderen schwingt immer das Gefühl mit, nicht optimal gekämpft zu haben. Man muss es nicht einsetzten, aber die Hemmschwelle ist auch sehr gering sich doch mal Hilfe zu holen. 3. Die besten Momente sind nicht in der Open World selbst: Am stärksten ist für mich Eldenring immer dann, wenn man in die größeren Dungens kommt. Hier kommt für mich die volle Stärke zum Vorschein, die Darksouls schon immer ausgemacht hat. Diese Dichte beklemmende Atmosphäre ist eine Riesen Stärke der Serie und durch die Open World kommen viel längere leere Phasen dazwischen, in denen gar nicht so viel passiert. Ja hier und da gibt es was nettes zu sehen, aber das ist zum einen nur selten belohnend, je nachdem welchen Spiele Style man priorisieren, zum anderen aber auch nicht sehr spannend gemacht. Ja es gibt Highlights, aber zu selten. 4. Der fehlende Fokus: Ich hatte zwei mal die Situation wirklich nicht mehr voran zu kommen. Das Spiel gibt einem manchmal so wenig Anhaltspunkte, wo es den jetzt wirklich weiter geht, dass man ewig lange in der Open World am suchen ist. Das ist vor allem dann ärgerlich, wenn man ein paar Tage nicht spielen konnte. Spätestens dann geht das Konzept nicht mehr auf und man muss googeln und das frustriert. Auch das hat Zelda besser gelöst, indem die wichtigsten Punkte markiert sind und der Rest man einfach irgendwie machen sollte. Zelda war hier zwar nicht ganz so frei, dafür deutlich fokussierter und auch irgendwo logischer. 5. Die Bosse: es gibt ein paar außergewöhnliche und sehr gute Bosse, dass kann und will ich nicht absprechen. Jedoch gibt es auch einen Haufen nicht so guter Bosse, die sich auch gerne wiederholen. Gerade bei den größeren Bossen ist die Kammera eine Katastrophe (Feuerriese) und machen deshalb auch nicht so viel Spaß. Vorherige FromSoftware Titel haben das alles deutlich besser hinbekommen. Hier sehe ich echt einen Rückschritt. 6. Die Technik: Ich habe hier definitiv kein Grafikwunder erwartet, aber wie manchmal die Texturen nachladen müssen ist einfach nur schlecht. Es kommt zu keinem Zeitpunkt ein Next Gen Gefühl auf. Fazit: Ich kann mir die teils hohen Wertungen nur so erklären, dass viele Leute wirklich keine guten Erfahrungen mit der Open World der letzten Jahre gemacht haben. Alles was Eldenring ausmacht gibt es in besser. Ghost of Tushima und Telda BotW bleiben meiner Meinung nach deutlich besser, selbst wenn solche Sachen wie die Charaktergestalltung eingegrenzter ist.",0.7000000000000001

It's difficult to put into words how satisfying the gameplay and polish of this game is but it's truly a crowning jewel of From Software's incredible efforts in the last few years.

"(First of all, I have never played any souls game before Elden ring came out, so my opinions are probably not as reliable as others.) I think that this game is a good game, but it's just repetitive a lot of the time. When I bought this game I was expecting to have a massive world that I could explore and go anywhere that I want. The world is big, but you can not explore it easily, and many areas are restricted. In my opinion, I think being able to just go anywhere on the map easily would benefit this game, similar to Zelda. On a positive note, I do think that the gameplay and difficulty are perfect, despite how hard it is. I do think this game definitely has its moments, especially when you are fighting a boss. This game probably has the most variety in terms of enemies and biomes, but a lot of the biomes are just bland and ugly. Another complaint I have is that the weapon/armor system is horrible. There is just way too many weapons that it becomes incredibly overwhelming to choose a good one that fits you. If someone were to ask me if they should buy Elden Ring, I would tell them that it really depends on the type of games that you like to play.",0.5

This can be good in some regards but it still doesn't match up to the standards that Bloodborne or even Sekiro set up for the company. Even with GRRM on the writing team, the story is absent and the music score is forgettable. Overall a little disappointing but still a decent game for the first 30 hours or so.",0.6

this game is far from perfect making an open world game and fill it with copied enemies and copied bosses and dungeons this is a ubisoft game more than a fromsoftware game the way that bosses are so slow when they try to strike is so ridiculous the only boss who I had fun fighting wit is the dragonlord Placidusax cuz he is different from the rest i hate this game and ragnarok is better,0.4

"Elden Ring es el resultado de más de una década de trabajo de parte del equipo de Fromsofware, puliendo las mecánicas y el gameplay hasta un punto en el que roza la perfección. No sólo es un juego del estilo Souls extraordinario, con batallas y enemigos memorables, complicados y , sobre todo, con un lore muy elaborado y extenso detrás, si no que también ha incorporado de forma fluida el concepto de ""mundo abierto"" , cosa que tiene mucho mérito al ser el primer juego del estilo que desarrolla esta empresa. He leído muchas críticas acerca del rendimiento en PC, pero, por lo menos yo, creo que no importa que haya alguna que otra bajada de FPS's cuando las cosas cargan, teniendo en cuenta que si no utilizamos el viaje rápido hay muy escasas pantallas de carga. Aprovecho para recalcar lo bien optimizado que está el juego para PS4/PS5, nunca me ha dado un tirón (salvo en cierta zona del mapa) y los gráficos también son bastante buenos. Pasando a otra cosa, la ""dificultad"" de la que muchos jugadores casuales se quejan, y de la que estoy bastante seguro será la causa de que Elden Ring no gane el GOTY (Aclaro que estos premios no pueden tomarse en serio después del robo de rdr2), no es alta, y puede ser incluso disminuida todavía más usando diversos ""cheeses"" o elementos desbalanceados como la lágrima mimética, RoB, Cometa Azur... o ""Burn O, flame"" contra Malenia, por ejemplo. Últimamente está siendo comparado duramente con God of War: Ragnarök, cuyos fanáticos más radicales desacreditan el mérito que tiene este juego (Hay que admitir que GoW 5 es un juegazo aunque a mí no me entretenga demasiado), habiendo sido creado por una empresa mucho más pequeña que Sony (Que cuenta con unos 100.000 trabajadores) y aún así haciendo competencia de esta manera. No me queda nada más que agregar, solo espero que Elden Ring sea valorado como lo merece (sin recibir tanto odio de los mencionados anteriormente) y que agreguen más contenido que podamos disfrutar, y volver a criticar, los que verdaderamente pudimos pasar de Velo Tormentoso ;).",1.0
"This is without a doubt the best game FromSoftware has ever done. This game is huge with tons of dungeons and areas and secret zones to explore, and you will want to explore all of it.

Games like this are far and few between, so you better be sure to buy it.",1.0

"Eldenring was my first soulslike game ever and it surprised me. The Atmosphere of this game is fantastic. Crazy good world building, cool bosses and cool items. It feels so rewarding playing along its so good. But this game also has many problems. For new players especially at the start it is very hard to get into a direction and know what to do. Some bosses in the early game are way to hard and they get repetitive after time. Combat is great but if you skill on 1 weapon it will get boring after time. The biggest down point of this game is that you do always the same thing. You kill, loot and fight the boss every single time but still a solid 9",0.8999999999999999

Please dont say that elden ring is **** when the game is actually so good its not overated or underated its just the people i dont understand they say the game is terrible but they didnt played any other souls like and dont know the objective of the game this game looks like dark souls 3 in 2016 these 2 games are damn good,1.0

The game is just absolutely incredible to play and look at! You can go anywhere at virtually anytime if you know what you are doing. The online combat is way better than the previous from soft games because of their new mechanics to power-stance and even jump. The game turned alot of people away just because of its skill gap but you just need to not press the buttons randomly as in sometimes you cant just spam R1 to victory sometimes you gotta time your attacks and not follow through with your combos because well he's gonna hit you in your face. Overall great experience over 700 hours in 6 different saves and i can tell you worth the 60$,1.0

The economics are such that prices for weapons and leveling up rise so fast that you have to spend all your time repetitively defeating the same enemies, just to keep progressing. It’s not that it’s “hard”, it’s that the power of the weapons and your abilities just make it not possible to progress without massive grinding. So, after 60 hours it’s just not fun. Also there are tons of items you find for which there is no discernible use. I keep accumulating them, bit nowhere in any menus or at any merchants can i use them.",0.2

"It's great plain and simple it's been made more digestible for new players, starting off initially it will be tough even but they great thing is the game doesn't force you to go a certain way it's a choose your own adventure so taking your time will be rewarded is a boss is too hard leave and go somewhere else until you're strong enough. The game is beautiful and huge and full of content. The only real bad thing is slightly boring dungeons and repeat bosses but those are almost always optional and serve as a way for you too level up easily. With age and hindsight the lowest I could give this games is possibly a 9 I've packed in 80 hours in this game and I'm still not even done with the main story and there are multiple endings as well",1.0

How could a game with massive environmental clipping and bad balance, somehow get worse? Fromsoft finds a way. Not to mention, the input buffer and lag alone drops it down to a 6. It just does. On top of that, the game is still unbalanced. You cannot have a good time playing the game how you want. Is this an enjoyable experience? Is it well balanced? Can you actually rely on skill to beat it? Is it playable? Are the enemy AI coded well? Do they just turtle and spam attacks and have input reading that seems to be coded by a student fresh out of game school? The answers to all these questions make me second guess myself. Except the last one- The answer to that is yes. I have well over 300 hours in this game.

"These are some of my thoughts as someone who doesn’t play a lot of games. When I first started I really did not like this. I’m a very “casual gamer” who is used to narrative heavy games like RDR2, AC Valhalla, Horizon, etc. I thought “Where’s my quest log? What am I supposed to do? Why is the first boss I face this gigantic sentinel?” It wasn’t until I realized “Hey dummy, just run past the sentinel. Go explore and find out what you’re supposed to do” that I really started to appreciate this game. There’s very little hand holding here. At first I felt this was to the games detriment however after figuring out some of the mechanics and focusing on leveling up my build properly (I was trying to put runes into a little bit of everything at the beginning) I started to appreciate how special this game is. It’s kind of like putting together a puzzle without a reference picture. Yeah it’ll be challenging but give it time, find the corner pieces and start making the boarder. I’m about 35 hours into the game and am not close to being done. However as the game progresses my enjoyment has continued to increase. The games bosses can be tough but fair. And if you can’t beat them right away go and get more runes to level up. From what I have gathered there’s no penalty to holding off on fighting bosses. I’ve had a great time playing Elden Ring. Overall I’d say 9/10 is a fair assessment. It is close to a 10/10 however I do think the developers could have added a journal or log of some kind for all of the little side quests and NPCs you meet.  There’s a ton and I found it super easy to forget about quest lines. You can use map markers but NPCs will bounce around the map sometimes. If you struggled at the beginning of this game like me I’d say go back and have another try. Really commit to a specific build. Find a weapon you really like and upgrade it early. If you’re stuck or don’t know where to start seek out the community online! There’s a ton of great resources out there that are designed to help newcomers like us.",0.8999999999999999

"I have found the frame rate and graphics perfectly acceptable in this game.  The desire to explore this beautifully rendered open world is quite strong.  However, it stops there.  I know a lot of players truly love the mechanics of figuring out how to defeat a tough boss, and this game will surely hit the mark for them.  For me, and those that really enjoy exploring an open world with some tension lingering to make the exploration process more alluring.  This game crushes that joy of exploration.  Explore a little, encounter a mob that takes a long, repetitive effort to defeat, explore a little more, then spend a long tine trying to defeat the next mob.  It saps all the fun and joy out of exploration.  I have purchased From After playing this game for awhile, I am revising my score from a 3, to a 10.

"Elden Ring might go down as one of the most ambitious games of the decades. Taking the already successful dark souls formula and expanding it to such a large scale was perhaps the riskiest move fromsoft could have attempted, however, it really paid off. Not only is the map about 5 times bigger than anyone imagined, it also is filled with enough content to justify the scale. The combat is taken and slightly refined from the previous fromsoft games, making it smooth and engaging. The bosses in this game rival some of the best from the dark souls 3 and bloodborne dlcs, each with their own unique dynamics and fighting styles. The game starts out so strongly and just continues to improve the farther you get in. There is always something off the beaten path, whether it be a cave or something else, which makes sidetracking and exploring worthwhile. The legacy dungeons as well are finely constructed and flow well with the rest of the open world, providing a nice balance between the two sections. While there are a few complaints to be levied at the game, such as certain bosses being bs or certain sections which just aren't fun, but ultimately these pale in comparison to the quality of the rest of the game. The main problem that I do think is apparent in the game is its lack of replayability. While this isn't a problem for most people since they won't play the game beyond their first time, for those who want to play again they'll likely notice that the game doesn't hold as much magic. This isn't to say it is not great, the legacy dungeons and the bosses are still a lot of fun on repeat runs but the traveling and the side content grows stale the second time around. However, this still in my opinion doesn't take away the fact that fromsoft created perhaps the best open-world game of all time and something which may change the industry for years to come. Elden ring should serve as an example for developers just what they can do if they are passionate about their craft and are dedicated first and foremost to creating an interesting experience for the players",1.0

This is the worst game I've ever played in my life. Everything about this piece of **** **** and it is unplayable. Selling this garbage should be considered an assault and the developers should face lifetime in the worst prison. You can compare this game with eating glass and drinking lemon juice with it.

"Elden ring is nothing short of a masterpiece. It combines all of the great things from all of their other games in one holy concoction. The game looks absolutely beautiful, and no 2 places are the same. It has some of the most difficult, but most fun boss fights in all of gaming.

"I HATED this game for the first week and just about traded it a few times. I was basically crap at it. I was urged by a friend to stick with it. Read up on it, got some tips on how to stay alive. I have never been so glad I stuck with a game, once you get properly into this game it’s hard to put down. I finished the game a few days ago and got the platinum trophy after 115 hours hardest I’ve had to work to get a platinum ever. I get some of the negative reviews but those will be from folk who gave up with the game. No one who has put a lot of time into this game could call it a bad game because it’s just not and probably will be GOTY 2022 unless God of War is even better somehow . This is the first souls type game I’ve spent time playing and I’ll probably give Demon Souls another go now that I understand a bit more about how to play them. Best advice is stick with it as this game 100% grows on you and gets under your skin!",1.0
"This game surpassed all expectations for this Fromsoftware fan. For me, it has taken the top spot for action RPGs from Skyrim, which is extremely high praise from someone who played that game for a decade. I was astonished by the amount of content in the game, and with the amazing combat system which is now a trademark  of Fromsoftware, it is easily my favorite action RPG of all time.",1.0
The game of the decade?  Certainly.  Why ?  The call of adventure in the face of a world that speaks only with its ruins and its fragments of stories.  A game where the characters are not generic and a game that does not seek to please everyone but only those who love video games as a whole.,1.0

"Chi critica questo titolo lo fa per difficoltà e ""assenza di storia"", ma la storia c'è eccome, ed è superiore a quella della maggioranza dei videogiochi, semplicemente devi scoprirla, non te la raccontano, devi leggere gli oggetti, e per quanto riguarda la difficoltà, è difficile ma meno di molti, e un tempo tutti i giochi lo erano. Con un minimo di pratica è un gioco che diventa alla portata di tutti, e quando impari non puoi più smettere. Aggiungerei, che nel marasma di open world tutti uguali, enormi e vuoti, con secondarie identiche, stesse meccaniche da Ubisoft ripetute fino al vomito e quant'altro, questo titolo si distingue eccome. Nessun punto della mappa è uguale ad un altro, i nemici hanno tutti un peso nella trama, ogni cosa ha un perché, il design è straordinario sia per mostri che per ambientazione. Unica nota dolente del titolo è il lato tecnico, non è un titolo next gen, ma con un comparto artistico del genere non pesa proprio per nulla. In conclusione, per chi non è avvezzo ai souls questo potrebbe essere un buon punto di partenza, essendo più semplice dei precedenti giochi From, ed avendo un open world ammaliante, per chi invece è avvezzo, questo titolo è un vero parco giochi, una evoluzione straordinaria che la saga meritava!",0.8

В столь массивной игре для каждого найдется свой ворох плюсов и минусов. Для меня бичом явились повторы некоторых уникальных боссов. В остальном сильных претензий к игре нет.

"By far the worst souls game ever made, the open world is extremely boring and full of copy+paste content. There is no fun way to traverse the open world. Boss fights are low quality and again a lot of them are copy+paste, I am talking about big story bosses that get shamelessly reused! It shows that FromSoftware didn't have enough time to develop this game properly. The boring empty open world is filled with wannabe pokemon summons called spirit ashe summons, you like collecting pokemons in your souls games? I don't. There is no meaningful reward, the game is too big for its own good, next time provide less quantity and more QUALITY, like previous souls games.",0.0

After a first few hours a bit stressful in which you get the mechanics the game became a delight, just what everyone says. But this relationship was broken after 70 hours, when you reach the final stretch of the game. That friend you think you know changes and shows his true nature. The game gives way to despair with enemies and areas completely unbalanced. No matter if you have gone slowly and exploring, as in my case, you are not able to defeat any boss without throwing away hours. Sickening stuff. The game is in its final stretch completely unbalanced. Unless you play with a specific class and build it is impossible to advance naturally. What's worse, you stop caring about the story and stop appreciating its amazing design. A pity after all those good times I had at the beginning. It's impossible for me to recommend such a thing to anyone. Have all those who call it game of the year really passed the game?",0.5

"Primer comentaré que no sóc un fan de la saga dark souls, he jugat bastants jocs pero mai m'han semblat obres mestres, mai fins ara. Elden ring ha sabut conjugar el millor de la saga i el millor de la llibertat dels móns oberts, no es tracta de que el joc ofereix una quantitat desorbitada de contingut, sinó de com el presenta. Tot en aquest món està cobert de misteri, tot sembla que busqui despertar la teva curiositat, és increïble com aconsegueix mantenir-te donant voltes sense un objectiu clar i que tot i així no decaigui l'interès del jugador en cap moment. La quantitat d'opcions i alternatives per fer front als enemics és inmensa i serà difícil que no trobis un estil de joc en el que et sentis còmode, aquesta és una altre de les millores respecte d'altres entregues, tens mil opcions per adaptar el joc al teu gust, i això pot arribar a ser realment gratificant. Per tots aquells que tinguin por de la dificultat, tinc bones notícies, el joc es exigent, però per primera vegada a la saga, si simplement explores i millores l'equipament i el nivell (cosa que succeïx de manera natural) pots fer front a tots els enemics d'una forma bastant senzilla.

So this time I knew to not buy Elden Ring and instead try playing a copy a friend of mine bought.  Really glad I didn't get it.  To make matters worse, the fan base tends to attract really toxic behavior.  Say anything about struggling to learn or play the game or it's design and you get a plethora of toxic attacks.

For new comers the mechanics are not user friendly, but nothing impossible to get if you actually keep playing the game. Graphics are pretty and the story is great. I am playing in quality and haven’t have any issue with frame rate. Only real complaint might be the fact that there is not a quest log, and by this I mean like a notebook or a diary, not a quest finder. There are a lot of quests and NPC interactions that are easily missable for the Nate fact that you forgot about the quest, soy you might end up reaching some place and killing the boss only to much later discover that you wrecked a quest haha.

Elden Ring is a masterpiece. It has one of the largest and grandest open worlds I have ever seen in a video game and it is a joy to explore.

"In all my many years of gaming, I have never seen a more overrated and overhyped game. I say that as somebody who adored every single Dark Souls game as well as Bloodbourne and others of a similar type such as Nioh and Nioh 2. The moment I stepped foot into Elden ring, I felt nothing but massive disappointment. I started as a Wretch and wandered around for hours looking for a single piece of usable gear without success. There was not a single moment of the spellbinding tension of the other souls games nor was the exploration particularly interesting as compensation. In fact, I don't think I enjoyed a single moment and ended up just giving up and deleting the game and never looking back. Man oh man what a disappointment that was. No idea what game the reviewers were playing but it couldn't possibly have been this one. ""Best game ever?"" After this debacle, I will never again buy a game based on professional reviews",0.3
"While the game isn't perfect, as none are, I think this game accomplishes more than any previous souls game in terms of managing to maintain its infamous difficulty while also being easier for new players to engage with due to the new open world setting. While it has a few poorly designed bosses, boss fights are predominantly fantastic and rewarding.",1.0

"This game is absolutely fantastic. I have never played a game that kept me interested for as long as the game lasted. The first few minutes of the game are not that interested because you don't know the scale of this world and what it has in store for you. But once you start to understand that part, it will blow your mind. I often find myself lost in the map just to stumble upon something incredible that would hook me for the next few hours. Secret dungeons, hidden worlds, weird modes of transportation, traps. This is a masterpiece. The graphics aren't that good to be honest, but it really didn't matter because the game was more enjoyable that anything else in the market. I guess the next milestone that FromSoftware need to reach is a visual fidelity. It will do this game justice because the level design is from another world.",1.0

This game was perfect because I always felt like I could explore somewhere else that I could handle at my level. Is a boss hard? Just go back after you gain some levels! I never ran out of places to go at my current level. I didn’t explore just to grind levels, it was a genuine interest in seeing what was over there. I played 80 hours before I beat the game, thinking I had done everything I could. Turns out I missed A LOT! I didn’t even fight Mohg on my first play through! 80 hours of fun engaging gameplay, and I missed sooo much still! Can’t wait to see what they do next.",1.0

The game has so many different weapons and armor, and spells at use to fit anyone's play style, they have small swords, medium swords, big swords, COLOSSAL swords, even whips, hammers, axes, bows, ballistas, staffs!

"My first time ever playing a souls game being that I am just an FPS cod and Battlefield player. It was super hard to get used to it and even gave up once. But it reminded me that it's more strategic and skill rather than spamming R1 and R2. I managed to start reading my enemies, upgrading my armaments, traversing the world, completing Rannis questline and beat the game a couple of weeks ago. Through all the rage I had the best time with this game and I'm not even 100 percent done with it yet. For a game, I purchased it for $60, compared to other games, It's worth every cent. I would recommend this game to anyone one of the best experiences ever. This inspired me to just start bloodborne and im really looking forward to it.",1.0
"It's good, I think, but I know it's not for me. The open world helps those like myself who found previous attempts at souls games to be frustrating time wasters because of the ""git gud"" mentality.

"The final boss of all souls games. A masterful game with so much to explore that I could honestly play for years. Beating the final boss was the most fulfilling thing ever. I could tell while playing this game that it was the finale of over a decade's worth of content. I think this is the last souls game, guys. There will likely be dlcs though, and while I'm looking forward to that, even after over 400 hours on the game I still am not bored and can wait as long as I like. As for the gameplay, it is excellent. It is different than the other souls games in that it is open world, but it's still a souls like at heart. The difficulty is high, like any other souls game, but when the going gets tough you can just do some side quests to get stronger, rather than banging your head against a boss that's too high level for you until you bleed out. The game allows for so much customization, rather that be all the awesome and unique weapons, the stylish armors, and even tons of spells and incantations. There are many different places to explore and many questlines and dungeons. Although some dislike the game for the amount of repetition, like repeated bosses, ruins, and enemies, I personally like that, it allows you to know what to expect when you enter a ruin, like after you find the cellar in gatefront, then another in waypoint, you know whenever you go into a ruin your immediate goal is to look for a cellar. Then, the game plays with those expectations and adds a trap in the cellar, or hide the cellar beneath and illusory wall. For me, this is easily the best game of all time, and I'm glad I got to experience it for myself.",1.0

Elden ring is a masterpiece **** I could truly feel the coolness of this open world fantasy game and on any platform you play it on the game still delivers at the extremely high expectation for this game. The boss battles are so well made that even though I died over 50 times to one boss I kept on wanting to pick up the controller and continuing and when you do finish a boss fight you feel like you achieved something incredible. The story is enticing and makes me want to keep playing after 6 hours of consecutive games. The only issue I will bring up is that I feel like multiplayer is quite difficult to pull of it would be cooler if you could just invite your friend instead of crafting a remedy then using it and also then your friends could stay after either you or them die as it is quite annoying because they could die really quickly and then you would have to do the remedy again but that doesn't stop the game from being one of the best fantasy open world games out there. What makes it a breath-taking experience of the sheer size of the map I'm not too fond of an extremely big map where your just walking for years on end and not seeing anything which is why I love this game as you can always be stumbling across something new and their is never a lack of content. So if your looking for an open world fantasy game that ties you in so you can almost stop playing Elden Ring is the game for you.,0.8
Not for everyone but once you figure out how the game works it really is a masterpiece. One of the best games I have ever played without a doubt. The world design is absolutely amazing. I'm sure I missed some things but I really tried to explore everything in my first playthrough and it took me about 160 hours to complete. I can't wait for some dlx. I wish other games gave me this sense of wonder and the amount of content is just absurd. The scale is jaw dropping. I absolutely love the open world. I should beat some other games on my backlog but I have to start another playthrough.,1.0

"This game is the most overrated game in some time. It is just dark souls 3 with open world. So naturally it will inherit everything wrong with that into this. Ok let me ask you question. Why do you like darks souls 3? Most people will say because of the bosses. But the thing is that the main gameplay loop - basically 70% of the game (which is the time spent going boss to boss) is absolutely trash. This is because the gameplay is super boring, clunky with outdated controls. Ok but you may say Elden Ring has open world. Its open world has the same problem as every other open world game. That being you can't make whole map full of new things. After Limgrave every other place is pretty much the same thing. Yes there will be some places which are unique but those are rare. There is no incentive to exploring places and enemies are just copy-pasted - there only so much dragons you can kill after you start pulling your hair. The gameplay is just bad, simply - absolutely atrocious. It feels like you in quick sand whilst the enemies are not. This is because the game has no cancelling - makes it so unresponsive. Most of the weapons are copies of each other and have no impact when using. It is quite sad, because if this game actually took inspiration from Bloodborne and Sekiro it would've been a much better game. Bloodborne's main gameplay loop is so much better, faster and has lot of impact. Bloodborne got rid of boring copy-pasted weapons and added trick weapons which are all pretty unique. But most importantly their ability to transform gives so many gameplay opportunities for combos and different strings.Also bloodborne and sekiro made the slow gameplay better by giving players the incentive to play fast and aggressively - got rid of the monotonous roll. There is so many reason why Bloodborne and Sekiro and better games, but I guess you get the point. Initially I was going to give this game 88, this was when I played it day one and finished it a week later. But in hindsight after thinking about all the flaws and not being blinding by hype - I can confidently say this game is no way 97 or a 85.",0.7000000000000001

It's also challenging while not being unfair and it gives you options to trivialise absolutely anything if you have no interest in the challenge.

The open world pulled me in and immersed me without overwhelming me, I felt rewarded instead of side tracked. Being mostly an  MMO player I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the vague quest design and story. It truly inspired me to figure things out on my own. After beating it 6 times in a short period of time I have since moved on to play all of fromsoft’s other games and beat all of them aswell.

This game is a masterpiece! Better than Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3. Which is very tough to beat both games. Elden Ring capture rich and beautiful architecture and gorgeous with dark fantasy. It’s easier to get into and very assessable to new coming players. I’ve been playing Souls since DS1 on 360. But this game is on whole another level. I’ll give it 100/10,1.0
"This is my first ever review, signed up to Metactic today. I am 57 and have been gaming for over 40 years starting with a Spectrum ZX81, Elden ring is probaly one of the best games I have ever played. I have never played a From Software game before, but this is just amazing. Its the exploring and discovering new quests and new areas (With the help of Youtube) I just dont want it to end, I am hoping DLC will be out by the time I have finished. My advice take your time and savour every moment of this fanatstic experiance. Just be prepared to die......a lot, but this is part of the just one more go, its not going to beat me feeling which is missing from a lot of games. Do you sell a favour buy it now and ignore any bad reviews.",1.0

"Elden Ring is one of the greatest games ever made. Vast and beautiful open world that offers cool rewards for exploration, deep combat system that allows you to make your own customized build with a HUGE selection of weapons and special weapon arts, wide variety of enemies that will always keep you on your toes as you explore the world, and SO MANY BOSSES that will present the best challenges for you. This game is hard. Do not approach your enemy without understanding that this world wants to KICK YOUR ASS. But as you progress your attributes and your weapons, it is honestly one of the best experiences a game can throw at you. You will feel absolute euphoria when you kill that boss that was destroying you. So, with all that being said, I recommend picking up this game. It’s so refreshing to see that a game lives up to AND exceeds the hype surrounding it. Easily GOTY and I’m here to stand behind it all the way.",1.0

"Игра оправдала мои ожидания! Геймплей на 9, сюжет на 6, Боссы-8(часто повторяются). Игра очень похожа на Dark souls, отличия лишь в том, что есть открытый мир. Порадовало то, что можно проскипать некоторых сюжетных боссов, хотя выглядит немного казуально. От Джорджа Мартина только: меч из мечей и титаническое количество драконов. В остальном обычный souls like, за что мне она и понравилась. Боссы в основном не сложные, хотя такие как : Маления, Мог повелитель крови и Радагон со своей зверюшкой - могу вызвать затруднения. В общем прекрасная и очень интересная игра с открытым миром.",0.0

"Elden Ring blew my expectations sky high. I am currently about 120 hours into Elden Ring and am still finding caves and bosses I haven't even seen before. I have completed most character side quests and have beat almost every major boss in the game but I can't wait to explore the Lands Between all over again with a new build in new game plus. Exploring the world of Elden Ring has been such a blast. The game is absolutely massive without feeling empty. I couldn't go five minutes without finding something cool or interesting in the world. The environmental design and art direction for every area, npc, armor, weapon, spell, and boss is outstanding. The lore and story of Elden Ring always peeked my interest and made me want to look through every item description to learn more about the world. There are some very memorable side quests and moments that I don't think I will ever forget. Some of the bosses in Elden Ring are among the best I've ever fought. Nearly everything about Elden Ring feels handcrafted to perfection. The only problems I have with the game are that there are a lot of repeat bosses and many bosses or enemies have extremely hard to dodge attacks that insta kill anyone with a low enough vigor. Also the game has some problems that are hard to avoid due to its scale, like how its hard to know how to continue a side quest without a guide and some of the repeat bosses feel poorly placed. But these problems are relatively small because the rest of the game is genuinely amazing. Overall, I think Elden Ring might be my favorite game of all time but I need some more time to fully decide that. Also anyone who is new or hasn't played a soulsborne game should play try Elden Ring before other soulsborne games due to the massive access ability the game lends to players. But one thing that is for sure is I will definitely be picking up every fromsoftware title I haven't played yet (Dark Souls 1-3 and Sekiro) and I will be getting the platinum trophy for Elden Ring. I can't wait for the dlc.",1.0

"I guess you could say that this is a Dark Souls meets an inferior version of Skyrim. The graphics and far from being next gen (I find the comparisons on this with Forbidden West hilarious). Frame rate ****. It's just another game that's hard for the sake of being hard leaving out a huge subset of players whereas Horizon Forbidden West gives the player a choice. If you love your game to be cheap and very difficult overall then you can have that. If you are just a casual player then there is that two and for everyone in between. Elden Ring? Nope. The big area of controversy lately has been between those who don't want much **** and those who want something like Witcher 3. Here again, Forbidden West gives you flexibility in choosing between a very detailed GUI to off when one doesn't want one or need it. This is very old school in everything from difficulty, graphics, game play, GUI and innovativeness (or lack thereof). In Forbidden West the graphics are photo-realistic, you don't feel isolated, it has more of a plot and the game play gives a wide range of different types. With that being said, if you love the Dark Souls type of games and/or retro games this is for you. Everyone else, good luck. You're going to at least being wanting to rage quite fairly often.",0.4

"An incredible achievement that brings Souls games into an open-world. Just an absolutely massive amount of content between new areas, optional bosses, optional dungeons, and exploration that could probably last years. In fact, the amount of content becomes quickly overwhelming. I also found myself preferring the level design of Dark Souls Remastered or Bloodborne over the open world. Still an incredible game and highly recommended. 9/10",0.8999999999999999
"I can not say that this game is the best ,game of the year .For me it's just repetitive,long,with very poor graphics and often **** most you struggle to do level up ,to run after a weapon that you upgrade to be able to pass a boss otherwise you have no chance,can not select difficulty.Sometimes during some fights you can not press the buttons if you do not confirm something you have previously found, for example a weapon. The graphics are pitiful for a super ""AAA""game,Demon Souls has 10 times better graphics.Those repetitive bosses, a long world, big but useless. I do not recommend, I recommend only Demon Souls to those who ask me. The last game from Software,I've played Bloodborne before. I will not repeat the mistake buying another game from Software.",0.4

"Un juego enorme, con la virtud de dar al jugador una gran libertad de como llevar su partida; con incontables secretos, armas, armaduras, que personalizan la aventura y la hacen única. Grandes ideas que ya al momento de jugar se van desvaneciendo, el combate es injusto, no en el sentido de que sea difícil, si no eso, injusto, abusan del instant kill, jefes con vida casi ilimitada, que en lugar de generar la sensación de aprender, como en otros souls, frustran, ya que siempre estás al alcance de que con un golpe te maten. El mapa es inmenso, pero se siente sumamente vacío, la gran mayoria de los enemigos puedes elegir pasarlos de largo, no hay gran cantidad de NPCs, hay peleas memorables, pero muchos jefes se repiten, en realidad no creo que pase de 10 los jefes realmente memorables y únicos. Creo que quisieron hacer un juego inmenso, y lo hicieron, pero esa inmensidad no necesariamente es una virtud, la moda actual es que mientras más haya que hacer en un juego o más hora dure es mejor y eso le pasa a Elden Ring, pudo ser un juego más concreto y ser una mejor experiencia",0.7000000000000001

I loved this game when it first came out but every single update has made me want a refund. They've made so your mount will run forward just by being on it. Spells will target directly into the floor; they've booster enemies coding to react to controller actions predicting player movements. I get that part of the appeal is supposed to be the randomized structure of the same move behaving several ways but it being based off camera angles means you will use the same move 3 times and sometimes they will go 3 times the distance and sometimes they simply work only directly in front of you. I hate these updates and I liked the game I bought but hate the game theyve updated it into,0.4

"This games world is enormous and filled with things to do. The beautiful design and lore of this game is remarkable and each location you reach seems to tell a story in itself. Enemy design is unparalleled. Fantastic music and sound. Combat is smooth and there is tons of different builds to play with. The absence of a quest log fits so well with this game. Allows you to adventure, how you’re supposed to, and explore yourself without dozens of waypoints and markers. It keeps you immersed in the world. I’m constantly in awe of how beautiful some of the locations look and even some of the enemy designs. The game is very accessible. Yes it’s a hard game but you can make it easier if you want. Farming runes to over level every enemy you come across and certain builds make some bosses seem like a joke. But you can play how you want. That’s what makes the game very enjoyable for me. It’s easier than most souls games but not because the actual enemies and bosses are easier but because of the amount of different tools and ways you can come at these enemies. You can also just walk away, level up, and come back later. The difficulty is masterfully balanced. If you have been wanting to jump into the Souls series, this is the game to do it. Don’t let the difficulty scare you from this masterpiece ****. If you are stuck or need help with what builds you can use, there are plenty of guides out there. You can also use summons to make fights easier and take some pressure off of you. It’s the most accessible Souls game. Play it. You will not regret it.",1.0
One of the best Open-world games ever. Build customisation and NPC quest lines are the best in the series. This game manages to do so many things so well. The legacy dungeons are all excellent with some of the best bosses in the series. Dungeons around the world have some great puzzles and level design however enemies are often overused. The boss variety is also often overused which makes getting to the end of a level fell a bit anti climatic. Overall this game is excellent with a few noticeable flaws.,0.8999999999999999

"Awesome, easily 10/10. I really can't say much more. It's beautiful, well designed and every time I think I've seen it all, I find more. I'm a huge fan of RPGs, but this is very unique. No quest markers, no hand holding. You must find everything out for yourself. The detail is incredible, you just have to look, listen, read and find it all yourself. People are whining about the lack of story, go look and spend time finding it all out. The lack of quest markers and quest design. Go look and find it all out for yourself. If you do you will find the rewards are very much worth the searching. Game of the year for sure. 100%. One of the best games I've ever played.",1.0
This game is amazing. The open world is great and makes you want to keep exploring. A lot of the bosses are overused which can be a bit repetitive.

"As a new souls player I was like many other players apprehensive about purchasing the game. The first 6 hours were tough but vital for the rest of my adventure in the lands between. I died many times and didn’t gain any runes but I did enjoy the exploration and eventually I gained the satisfaction of killing a boss and some difficult enemies. After these 6 hours I experienced without doubt the greatest game I have ever played (2nd isn’t even close by the way). I’ve spent around 160 hours in the game and will be completing multiple playthroughs. Fantastic world design, exploration, multiple armor sets, weapons, skills, varied enemy design and some fantastic boss fights. My warning to new players is the game does not hold your hand and will not give you a clear path. You will have to explore and pay attention to the the dialogue for little clues and lore. If side quests interest you then you will need a guide. Some of the side quests are excellent and full of lore but easy to fail or get lost. I know some won’t like doing this but the lore, boss fights and rewards make it worth doing. I’m at the end of my first playthrough and have just defeated the hardest boss (optional) and already planning my next one. 10/10 Insane rating",1.0

Never played a dark souls game but this is easily one of the best games I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing. The world is so huge and expansive and the difficulty is basically optional based on the weapons and build you give your self so if your stuck on a boss or a certain area just go somewhere else and level up or find a sick new weapon to destroy everything with in the ginormous map. The only problems I have with the game is sometimes the controller would be unresponsive but it was very rare and that when you lock on to an enemy the game can just randomly lock you on to another enemy if you look in there direction which is very annoying in the heat of battle but you get used to it.,0.8999999999999999

"First off, not my first SoulsBorne game, I have played and finished DS1, DS2, DS3 and BB several times, this game has good visual, interesting lore and at first the exploration is fun and so is the PVP, but that's where the praise end, the game feels highly inconsistent, Bosses deal too much damage, are too fast and for some reasons can move cancel, they're made in a way you're expected to be with someone else, they have the speed to deal with 2 players, which makes It unfair for the ones alonethe fall damage is really weird, falls that shouldn't kill you do, and the ones that should don't, level desing out of the open world feel like a straight line, enemys deal too much damage, Boss and enemy desings are lazy, they all feel like a glob of meat with a lot of hands and legs, the game repeats A LOT of content, you will fight the same boss at least 5 different times, and depending If they turn into a common enemy even more, exploration gets old kick, the game has over 80 boss fight and 9 Bosses aren't reused, the game doesn't know how to space out checkpoints, so they're everywhere, and sometimes the game kills you very cheaply, most areas fell uniteresting, as basically everything is a forest, I don't think this Is a master piece.",0.6

"Although it is beautiful and the design is great, enemies are so dumb and robotic it feels like you're playing a vintage game that's had a very expensive face lift. You can sneak up on enemies that are directly looking at you and avoid almost any foe with ease. And I'm not playing on easy mode. Forget about range weapons, these seem to be an after thought. Menus and leveling system are pretty poor too. Still can't make sense of how to map certain items to shortcuts. Not what I'd expect for a premium title.",0.3

"Great feeling of exploration, the world is huge.   Boss fights are amazing.",1.0
"GOTY EASY unless Valve decides to drop Portal 3 Outta nowhere I don't see how anything beats it. One of the major elements that makes this game so incredible is it's open world. The open world doesn't feel forced like many games but feels like a natural evolution of dark souls. A problem I have with open world games is how many times story telling is done through dialogue. This isn't bad but is quite a lazy and forceful way to approach world development. Dark Souls has the habit of letting it's world speak for itself and that aspect of dark souls compliments an open world design. Elden ring also has a plethora of weapons to experiment with and build your character around. The element of respec ing brought in from Dark Souls 2 allows you to experiment with your build. The enemy variety in this game is off the charts although plenty of bosses are reused. It can get tedious to fight the same boss again with only minor changes but all of the repeated bosses are optional and something you mainly just fight for better loot so you can fight other harder bosses more easily. There are a few late game bosses with are overly aggressive but 2-3 hours for frustration in no way sours the hundreds of hours of enjoyment you have in this game. The main quest is quite straightforward and easy to follow but some side quests will require you to go really out of your way to complete which is something a lot of people might not like but a counterpoint to that is these quests enhance the sense of discovery like no other game does. If there was a straight line pointing you to all the right places the open world would lose a lot of it's meaning. I don't want to talk about the graphics of this game as there are the beta cucks that complain about them whenever a single ray of light doesn't bounce of their character's **** at the right angle but it's safe to say that Elden ring is a beautiful game and it's art direction is out of this world that more than makes up for it's graphics which are already pretty good. The only thing I can complain about is maybe the multiplayer, dark souls has never had a good history with multiplayer although the net code is better than it's previous games it's right now far from ideal and a few balancing issues plague the game as well as certain weapons that are fun to use in single player aren't very fun used against you in multiplayer, it is a minor gripe however something I've learnt to let slide as the souls community when it comes to multiplayer is very good and sometimes the toxic parts can be fun. If you are a souls fan you are guaranteed to love this and if you aren't this game will definitely make you want to go back and try out their other titles (I recommend bloodborne it's my personal favourite). This game is definitely a masterpiece and has me looking at Fromsoftware with eager eyes to see what they come up with next as it will has big shoes to fill.",1.0

In a few words its a great game Looking it objectively and truly playing and learning how to explore without spoon feed information for the quest will make you want to play more, there's people that complains about the dificulty but that just make it much more rewarding when you achieve your objectively or defeat a boss that took you many tries.

Its worth every penny as i got 110 hours out of it without doing anywhere near everything that you can do in this game.  The world is really interesting and fun to explore but I give it an 8 because the narrative isn't great.  And no I don't just mean I didn't read all the item descriptions to get the story, I mean that even with that there are still massive plot holes and things that just don't make any sense.  In particular I really don't like any of the endings and they are all super short.  After such a long time spent with a game I want a satisfying conclusion and this game just doesn't have it.

Every boss feels amazing to fight and punish you just enough for your mistakes and reward you for manipulating the boss into moves that you know will guarantee you damage on the boss. The bosses are incredibly creative with amazing designs. The endgame is incredibly fun as you can go back and kill the bosses in caves and dungeons that you were not able to kill in the beginning of the game and get new items from them to use in your next journey.

"I have played every souls game from demon souls to bloodborne and sekiro, but I have never felt like any of the other games are as cheap as this one. This one pretends to be difficult but is just cheap. What I mean by that is that while previous games reward patients and learning, elden ring rewards getting lucky eventually. You just keep on trying until eventually the stars happen to randomly align and you beat a boss. Very frustrating, even when you beat a boss, you can look at it and think that the only reason you won was luck. There is no satisfaction in that. I have given it a chance, I have pushed through 80 hours, hoping that it would be the amazing game I hoped it would be. Unfortunately, it is not.",0.3

"For people who really experienced the game, this is much more than a simply Dark Souls game. Elden Ring offers an open world, full of interesting places to explore, more than 100 bosses, and do the most important thing: NOT CARRY THE PLAYER! Real gamers want to experience the game and achieve goals by themselves, so a game must force you to think, to do better decisions, and in this cryteria, Elden Ring delivers. It is not the most difficult game of From Software, but it will **** your life for weeks. It is a masterpiece.",1.0

The respec feature and ash of war feature allow for an endless possibility of playstyles, and allow players to approach challenges when they are ready and explore first through its vast and open, yet full and complex world. Every player can find a playstyle that suits them and while the game is very difficult, it is still very accessible to everyone. Have never been more satisfied with a game before.",1.0

"As a soulsborne fan i wanted to give the game a 10, but that would be wrong because it's far from perfect. Many things are copied from ds, like when i was in stormveil castle i realy felt like i was in dark souls,  most of the game you are in open areas some of which are very beautiful and horse makes it fun to explore, also fighting on a horse really changes the gameplay makes it more dynamic like in sekiro, but it's seriously not as much as some people say it is, like people buy fifa and call of duty every year, and these games are basically the same every time and people forgive that. Game is a lot like bb in a way that it is between ds and sekiro but bb leaning towards ds and elden ring towards sekiro. Soulsborne fans will like it, some new people will come but as with all from soft games before some people will not like difficulty and will hate it",0.8

The game is grindy, repeats bosses, glitches out in frame rate during boss encounters (looking at you tree sentinel), and there is such a lack of any story which is funny because they attached George R Martin to this.

They're fun facts of a dying world.. I know there is a superb game in there somewhere but unless you can afford to put the dozens of hours into ""getting good"" or you're already a fan boy of the company you're probably going to be miserable.

"Elden Ring is not a bad game, far from it. In a nutshell, it's Dark Souls 4. It has all the strength of the Souls series, but still has all its issues. Moreover, Elden Ring has a big lack of novelty. You can use a ""horse"" and jump, that's all. When Sekiro or Bloodborne tried to push the souls series in a different way, Elden Ring simply reuse the DS recipe. It also reuses skins, animations, textures, and the old DS graphics, so, even 1 year and a half after the PS5 release, it feels like you're playing on a PS4.",0.6

I don’t finish many 40+ hour games because, eventually, my sense of immersion is lessened or gone completely, and I feel like it’s time to move on. Sometimes I push through to the end credits and just don’t feel that satisfied with the adventure; there’s always that feeling of “I should be doing something else right now” lingering in the back of my head. My first playthrough of ER took 117 hours. When it was finished, I felt like I’d gone on an epic journey. I’m looking forward to the next playthrough.

"This is my first soulslike game. I wasn't going to play it but I picked it up because of they hype surrounding the game, and I can't put it down. I love the world. I love exploring it, and I love that the game rewards you for exploring it. It feels to me like an RPG should. I love that you learn about the story through interactions with NPCs, enemies, and exploration. It really feels like you're making your own story in the world, and I think that's something a lot of RPGs today miss out on. I wasn't sure I'd enjoy the difficulty level in the game, but I can honestly say that I enjoy it. It's hard, but fair. Beating bosses feels meaningful. One of my favorite things about the game is the art direction. Some people have complained that it's graphics fall short of top tier for gen 5 systems, but the game's art direction more than makes up for it. I think it's going to continue to look beautiful for decades to come even as graphics continue to improve. I really can't recommend this game enough. It's one of my new favorites.",1.0

"Elden Ring is a beautiful, engaging and challenging experience. It's biggest downfall is the co-op play. The game was advertised as a co-op environment but its very limited. The multi player is very specific to areas, bosses and challenges, not open world like other games. it takes a few steps to get together with a friend and sometimes you don't even know if you can do something together until your at a spot when you need them. It's taken the fun out of the whole experience. I would recommend this game for single players only.",0.3

"My final and brief opinion on Elden Ring: They were right on many things, they were wrong on many others as well.  The first experience is incredibly memorable and the main bosses are amazing, the lore is nothing to talk about, although I think it's very similar to Dark Souls and lacks a bit of originality.  The problem is that there comes a point, more precisely in the second half of the game, that it gets very repetitive, the optional bosses are very forgettable, the boss repetition is ridiculously annoying and the game balance is so unstable to the point that you are OP without nor make effort, ruining the Experience.  The soundtrack is far inferior to past games, especially if we compare it to Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne, you can count on your fingers which ones are really memorable and incredible. The exploration of the world itself is phenomenal and intuitive, it's really a revolution of the open world system, but unfortunately that's only true for the first time playing, making the game have very little replay factor, as you've already seen all the new exploration. In short, the game is amazing and extremely fun and addictive, it has a lot of successes but it also has a lot of flaws.  For FromSoftware's first open world game, I'd say they are to be congratulated, they improved a lot from the other games, but honestly it could have been better.  If they had more creativity and time, the game would be immensely more memorable and most of the game's serious flaws would be minimized.  Overall, it's an unforgettable game on your first playthrough and it's really worth it, it's not quite a masterpiece as many have said, for me it's basically an open world Dark Souls 4, but it's worth the investment, especially nowadays where the market of Videogames only cares about money and quantity, while FromSoftware cares more about the artistic factor and quality in their games. Final rating: 8/10",0.8
"Don’t listen to all these trashy reviews saying the game is terrible, this game is easily one of the best games to ever be made, the whole experience of a souls game is dying over and over because it’s supposed to be difficult, you’re just complaining that you couldn’t get past most things, and you’d just run away from them. This game has amazing gameplay and amazing graphics and all other goods, this is easily game of the year. I’ve beat the game several times myself and I haven’t found boredom yet, it’s just combat on combat, and if you’re reading this saying “oh all you do is go around on your horse all the time there isn’t any combat” that’s just because you’re too scared to lose to the enemies, they’re everywhere and you can find combat almost every place you go. Easy 10/10 my favorite game.",1.0

"Elden Ring (10/10 Masterpiece): The perfect game for a Souls Borne fan. Elden Ring delivered exactly what I was looking for in a new IP open world Souls Borne game. An interesting story, a great setting, and most importantly, kick ass combat. Souls Borne combat has never been better with a massive amount of build variety and varying combat options with the addition of horseback battle, spirit ash summons, and weapon arts. The game is absolutely massive with hours and hours of interesting exploration and punishing but fair boss battles. In terms of critiques, Elden Ring does suffer from a large, unexpected difficulty spike in the last couple areas and multiple repeat bosses, but these minor gripes pale in comparison to the sheer amount of content and hours of fun offered in this game. My most memorable moment has to be finally pushing through an extremely difficult optional boss’s health pool only to discover an equally punishing second phase. This is one of the best games I have ever played and one of the few that I had a hard time putting down to get some needed sleep.",1.0

"It's funny how most of the negative votes are for graphical issues, for an empty open world, and for its poor narrative level, something that is completely true. But FromSoftware has never stood out for the technical section, and has never pretended to, its beauty lies in the artistic and sound section, where it excels above any video game saga. Nor has it ever tried to tell its stories through dialogues, its lore resides in the objects you find and in the small conversations you find through its world with different characters, a different way of telling its stories that it has been doing since its beginnings, why would anyone expect that to change now? It's absurd. It's funny how in this way it manages to catch me and wrap me in the deep need to learn more about its lore, however in the rest of video games where there are hundreds of dialogues and cinematics they get me to disconnect automatically from the conversation, losing interest in its story. Finally, people expected to find a living open world, in the style of RDR2, Horizon FW or Zelda BOW, but they already made it clear repeatedly that it would be something very simple, something similar to Shadows of the Colossus, simply an interconnected open world, nothing more. I hope FromSoftware will never change their way of developing videogames, because once again, they have created a masterpiece",1.0

"As a Bloodborne fan (With a platinum trophy) and Soulslike fan (Played Sekiro, Lords of the fallen, Dark sousl 1, 2, 3, Demons Souls...) I can say that my hype for Elden Ring was too high. When i play the game for the first time, it was nothing as i expected, the graphics are meh (in the ps5), the framerate wasnt a consistent 60fps; the ""open-world souslike game of the dreams"" was nothing more than an outdated graphics game with an easy dificulty (when compared to bloodborne for example) and with a lot of bugs and framerate drops. The game is fun, the world is massive and you have a lot to do, a lot of weapons and settups, but something in this game deoesnt touch my hearth :(  .... sad, thst is al.

I will never forget Exploring Limgrave with nothing but awe and excitement. I already put 80hrs into getting the Platinum on my first playthrough.

The performance is rock solid on my PS5.  The graphics, while not cutting edge, are adequate, and most importantly maintain a near solid 60 fps.  The only downside for some is that this is a Fromsoft and the combat is punishing and requires patience and the willingness to learn.  Two real world character traits that seem rare in 2022. The negative reviews strike me a coming from two groups of people.  Group one  is neophytes expecting another Skyrim.  Group two is Dark Souls hardcore fans who want another Dark Souls.

"Bestes Spiel was ich je gespielt habe. Das best of von FromSoftware mit der besten Open World die es gibt. Es gibt überall etwas zu entdecken und nachdem ich das Spiel 4 mal durchgespielt habe, weiß ich bestimmt immer noch nicht alles. Alleine wie die Karte aufgebaut ist, ist genial gemacht. Man schaltet langsam immer mehr frei und fragt sich die ganze Zeit wie groß das Spiel sein kann. Das Spiel bietet viele gute Waffen von denen man die meisten gerne ausprobieren würde. Die Bosskämpfe gegen die Demi-Götter wurden extrem gut inszeniert. Wenn man sich die Lore durchließt erkennt man auch wie durchdacht diese ist. Das Spiel ist sogar einsteigerfreundlicher als die Vorgänger. Wer eine Herausforderung sucht, kann im 1 gegen 1 gegen Bosse kämpfen, wer keine sucht, kann die Beschwörungen nutzen. Dass man Waffen aus einer Kategorie zusammen verwenden kann, ist eine massive Verbesserung im Vergleich zu Dark Souls. Ich könnte noch vieles weites aufzählen, was das Spiel alles richtig macht, aber es macht fast alles richtig. Selten habe ich mir bei einem Spiel von solch großem Umfang dennoch gewünscht, dass es noch weiter geht. Ich hoffe einfach darauf, dass es neben Dlcs noch eine Fortsetzung geben wird.",1.0

"I'm a massive fan of FromSoftware games. Bloodborne is my favourite game. A masterpiece. It was a game that i bought a ps4 to play and the game didn't match my expectations... It surpassed them. Just writing this post just makes me want to play Bloodborne again. Elden Ring got me all hyped. I bought a ps5 to play it and I'm sorely disappointed by my experience. I'm 90 hours into the game and it's boring. It's (excuse the pun) a soulless experience. This game suffers from what Metal Gear Solid 5 suffered from. It just didn't need to be open world. FromSoftware excels in tight level design. This is their first stab at open world and it shows. You end up riding around a dull world looking for action only to be confronted with too many bosses, many of which are lazily recycled. I'd prefer a smaller world packed with danger around every corner and less but more unique enemies. FromSoftware fell into the trap for open world games that more is better. I bought this digitally so I'm really pushing myself to finish it but after 90 hours in struggling. And not due to the difficulty. The game doesn't reward the players time. Empty, barren worlds with crappy gifts at the end of a dungeon or mini boss isn't fun. Bloodborne **** all over this game. I've been playing FromSoftware games since demon soul's on ps3 and (excluding ds2 and sekiro) this is my biggest disappointment. Dark souls 2 gets a pass because the FromSoftware B team made it and sekiro was an entirely different game with a few overlapping mechanics. Elden Ring could've and should've been their magnum opus but instead ends up as just another bland and repetitive open world game.

Everything in this world has a purpose and you can tackle it however you want. People might be turned off by the difficulty, let me just say this is my first souls game and the game is challenging but not enough to make me not want to play it. You can make the game easy if you want by getting overpowered gear and magic sorceries. Also there’s summons to help you with bosses. It’s up to you how you want to play it. There are tons of bosses that you can go after to get rewards to help you on your journey. From software(The Developers of this game) makes sure you are very well rewarded. If you are on the brink of getting the game, try it and give it some time. You‘lol get the hang of it and you’ll realize this is something special. One of the best games ever.",1.0

"Elden Ring is amazing. To me, what makes it shine is the sense of mystery that stays fresh even after hours &amp; hours of gameplay. I would compare it to Breath of the Wild, or the oldschool Elder Scrolls games of yore. The combat is also great and feels very visceral. It's fun to think of the perfect build, but ultimately it's an RPG and your character will gradually get more powerful over time. What really makes this game special is that every single area feels meticulously handcrafted, and you keep uncovering subtle game mechanics as the game goes on. Personally - I played it single-player without FAQing anything. I find the messages from other players to be more distracting than helpful. (Minor spoiler) My favorite moment thus far? Exploring the magic academy in Liurnia of the Lakes is gorgeous and surreal - I went down a strange elevator to be killed by a mechanical creature, and what?! Then you find yourself in a volcanic area for unknown reasons!",1.0

"Elden Ring is too good to be explained. Literally i could go on for the entire alotted character length about how great it is. The gorgeous, wonderfully designed open world draws you in, rewards your exploration, and flat out drops your jaw! The characters and lore are so rich and well thought out, and the fact you have to go and discover it yourself to get the full picture makes finding out what and where and why such a wonderful revelation. Youll stop and just think, or stop and take in your surroundings, stop to just appreciate what a fantastic experience it is and the world you find yourself surrounded by. Finally a game delivers on the hype and over delivers in such a way it leaves me at a loss for a good explanation of how absolutely fantastic it is.

In terms of gameplay, you get a damn heavy and challenging action role-playing game for the console and PC. In addition, further improvements and patches are planned.

I don't want some other nerds idea **** game whether i like it or not, i want fun. This is a grindy death grind of bleak boring old gamey ness. People who like these games weird me the f out!

"Elden ring Is a fantastic game I'd love to play constantly if I were not so busy. It's detailed story lines and open world concepts and seriously hard bosses are the best! I'm rating it an 8/10 as I have 2 problems to address. Summoning in the game even with passwords and connections are terribly slow and unreliable and secondly FromSoftware hasn't addressed a fix to this even when it has effected so many players Including myself from enjoying the game with a friend. I am currently at a difficult boss and needed a helping hand, what happened was an error ""Unable To Summon Cooperator"" that can be many issues such as Internet connection or location of summoning signs however I've been trying for roughly 3 hours and multiple attempts spanning days and yet again no mention from the company.",0.8
Captivating open world with something to do anywhere you go. The boss fights have great design features. They are very difficult however it’s an open world and the game encourages you to explore and level up to finally beat that boss. Incredible graphics. Some downsides are frame drops when loading into a world or getting attacked by a boss and no real directions really are present there with quest lines and how to find certain resources which lead to skipping them or looking up a video. But in the end it’s a phenomenal game.,1.0

"Beautiful game, exquisite immersion on a vast beautifully crafted open world. Been playing around 30 hours and it's really a must play. even if you are new to From software games. This is not a 10 because of some FPS drops happening on PS5. No other issues, really the only one, but i think they must be addressed and corrected as soon as possible. This game may be a master piece...",0.8

"Eh, I don't know what Kool Aid everyone's been drinking, but it clearly didn't work on me.  This is an above-average open world game, but it isn't without its faults.  Particularly notable are the repetitious use of dungeons and enemies that really start to wear on you during the second half of the game.  The combat also is unrefined, with many bosses glitching out, one particular battle saw a formidable opponent getting stuck in a tree and spontaneously combusting.  Moreover, as melee class, battle is entirely dependent on i-frames, there's a lack of responsiveness to the process of combat, that sees luck play more of a role than skill in that sense.  Stranger of Paradise surprisingly does combat much better than this game.  While I would recommend it, and I don't consider it too hard for the average player, I can't do so without at least acknowledging that it runs out of ideas in the later parts of the quest.",0.7000000000000001

"This is a game that is loves the smell of it’s own farts. It looks great but has poor design and problems that are passed off as difficulty. I get that the game is not for button mashers, but when not in combat there are countless times when button actions do not register. Even in non-boss encounters… this sets you up for boss battles whee your button presses are stacked. Your character will carry out those stacked actions if it’s the MOST important thing in the world, EVEN if you get hit. Also no good world orientation and very basic story",0.5

While new players may struggle to get to grips with the difficulty. They do offer so many things to aid you if you are stuck. Even leveling up you start to feel like you can handle something you couldnt even better. Overall I'm 90 hours in and cannot put the controller down.",1.0

"Luego de 60 horas jugando Elden Ring, puedo afirmar que estoy frente a uno de los mejores juegos que he tenido el placer de probar en mi vida. Quedando mucho contenido opcional que probar, y casi llegando al 70% de los trofeos obtenidos, quisiera destacar en primera instancia su extenso mapa, cantidad de enemigos (jefes y no jefes), y variedad de contenido; mazmorras, castillos, bosques, llanuras, lagos, costa, todo lo que sea posible de imaginar en un juego de estas características. Su diseño artístico es magnifico, y si bien el motor gráfico se nota ya algo desfasado a los tiempos que corren, no quita el espectáculo visual que implica posicionarse en lo alto de ciertas zonas para ver a lo lejos castillos, montañas, y sobre todo ese majestuoso árbol que cubre el total de las tierras intermedias. A nivel de jugabilidad no hay mucho que decir: es Dark Souls en su punto más alto, agregando accesibilidad opcional para quien lo necesita (cenizas de guerra y cenizas, áreas para invocar NPCs o jugadores online, y posibilidad de farmear experiencia recorriendo el mundo que se ofrece). Los jefes principales y secundarios ofrecen combates memorables, algunos un tanto injustos por sus mecánicas, pero al fin y al cabo un desafío posible de abordar con tiempo y paciencia. El juego es una celebración a la historia de los juegos de Fromsoftware, con referencias constantes a la Saga Souls, Sekiro y Bloodborne. Por último, quisiese destacar su narrativa, que en muchas reseñas ha sido menospreciada, pero que me parece de una factura notable. Muchos no notaron la influencia de George R. R. Martin en la construcción del mundo, pero al igual que en todo Souls deben ahondar más para encontrar lo que se quiere contar: traiciones, disputas familiares, y la sed de poder por quedarse con el trono son sólo algunos de los aspectos que se intentan narrar en esta épica de fantasía oscura (de hecho, no me sorprendería ver una precuela en formato videojuego o serie/película). Para quienes deseen disfrutar este aspecto, y realmente le importe la narrativa del juego, les aconsejo intentar relacionar a los distintos personajes, jefes, y semidioses del juego entre sí. En resumen, probablemente el juego del año, que me dejó muy satisfecho y con una angustia luego de haber completado el contenido principal y parte del opcional.",1.0

"I was at first questioning if this game was going to be good or not since most of the newer games released in the past few years have been either rushed , lazy or flat out broken , but Elden Ring proves to be one of the best games this year. With the gigantic world that have hundreds of things to do , boss battles that are thrilling and amazing to beat , and the beautiful story that comes along. Elden Ring is a must play for people who enjoy soulsborne games and people who have never heard it. I've already sunk in around 115 hours and i've beaten the game a second time. I still saw new things that I've never seen before. An honest 10/10 for the game and congrats to the FromSoftware team.",1.0
"I think Elden Ring is an amazing game with deep interesting lore and obviously an amazing open world filled with dungeons and secret entrances filled with enemies with their own unique move sets and their own unique boss encounters. The weapon variety is a mad from sorceries to spells to great swords to bows and more. The story is surprisingly interesting and tells you very little about how to get there. Obviously this isn't for everyone the game doesn't even have quest log or a journal to follow you need to remember what to do and you need to find it. But the level design is not as good as it should be. It's still great but sometimes it is horrible. Trying to complete the frenzied flame ending was so stupid. You need to parkour down some tombs to reach the bottom where you can finally defeat the boss. Sometimes sites of grace are put in the worst places. For example the site of grace near where you fight Leonine Misbegotten is so badly placed it is unbelievable sometimes enemies hit through walls, sometimes the game crashes and there is pop-in everywhere. Rhadan has been nerfed at the time of writing which i hate because Radahn was always viewed as a big opponent and that the odds were stacked against you but now he's not. I beat him in one go when i was underleveled. Everything I've meantioned apart from the level design problems i believe doesn't  take away from the game. It takes a while to get into but once you do you can't stop.",0.8999999999999999

"I’ve never played a FromSoftware game before. Elden ring is a return to what gaming should be. No micro transactions. No pay walls. They’ve delivered an absolutely polished, fun game. I wish there was more cohesiveness with the story and lore to get you a little more captivated in the world. Sometimes it just feels like you’re going here to kill that “because”. But that’s alright, every other aspect of the game is basically amazing. I got exactly what I paid for. And I received more value and content than I had originally intended. With this being said, I haven’t seen a game come out where I was like “this is a masterpiece” since RDR2 and perhaps, The Witcher. I will be sure to keep an eye on future FromSoftware games and would recommend anyone who is up for the challenge - BUY IT. Is there issues? Yes. But in this day and age, this is exactly what I’m looking for out ****. Complete, no bs, beautiful landscapes, runs smooth on the Xbox series X. They delivered exactly what they promised (and more). For that I have to give Elden Ring a 10/10 and other publishers and developers should take note.",1.0

"So far, this is the closest game to what I dreamt an heroic fantasy D&amp;D game could be. Yes hard but the open world allow you to level and explore even if you cannot beat a boss (to some degree). The game is beautiful, very fluid (PS5) except for some lag spike. Only true negative would be for the lack of help to novice players.  I did not google it before buying and the start was very difficult, and I almost gave up. I had to spend hours on YouTube after that to learn how to play. The tutorial (that I missed at first) does not cover magic at all !! Yes if you had infinite amount of time, you can try and learn, but for real users with daily job, at least add some in game method to learn. It is unnecessarily made into an experienced users-only.  At level 70, I barely defeated 3 of the ""main"" bosses but I admit i am hooked.",0.8

"Very buggy, can't even hit 60fps on ps5 steadily even though a game as heavy as Ghost of Tsushima runs at a locked 60fps with no loading time, this is very unoptimized. I die randomly at elevators, horrible grass pop in, dungeons and most other world bosses are copy and paste, game is hard in late game just for the sake of being hard, seems like From has forgot why people play these games. Sekiro and Bloodborne were their best games, and those games were difficulty done right. No matter how much of a tank you're, everything in haligtree and snowy mountaintops will 2 shot you. Enemies and bosses are designed to attack you as soon as you hit square to heal, crucible Knights will just stand there do nothing but as soon as you press R1 their hitting animation will start and they'll hit you first, it's just designed to F you over. I sound like a broken record but the game is difficult just to F with the player. It's unfair, you get gank boss fights in every corner of the game, they went back to dark souls 2 days where they put 500 enemies in one room and they call that fair difficulty. Godskin duo!?? Really!!? Seems like they ran out of time and were like ""aha! Let's put these 2 bosses in one room and call it a new boss, oh also. Let's make them self revive"". Also, this game **** on the face of every STR player , by making every strength weapons scale with either INT or FAI. Even if you get one of these heavy weapons, it'll be absolutely useless, because every late game boss is gonna be 100 times faster than you, rendering your STR build useless.

"I love this game. It feels like Hidetaka Miyazaki and his team put everything they learnt from making other souls game and applied everything that was good about them into one game. It shows George R R Martin wrote the script for this game. Even though the story is vague as expected from such games, whatever is there is full of depth. The bosses are exceptional. Even though you’ll die a lot but when you overcome a challenge you’ll be exhilarated. I like their take on open world games. I feel like from now on every other open world game that is going to come out it will be compared to this game. I like instead of going semi open world (linear) souls like games it went full open world. Instead of telling you what to do, it just leaves you be yourself and explore. No overcrowded UI. Instead of crowding the UI with unnecessary stuffs it lets you enjoy the beautiful world they created. Even though there are some improvements that could’ve been done, but I feel they did an exceptional job. I am looking forward to more games like this.",0.8999999999999999

"Masterpiece these nuts. Overestimated product whose lore is a half-written pile of garbage. It runs like my paraplegic great-grandmother with parkinson's disease, because it stutters profusely, crashes every 30 minutes and suffers from input lag. The rushed release also brought a lot of collision related issues. The graphics are meh for a game of these years and the NPCs are garbage characters with 2 lines of dialogue. The game endings are ridiculously bad and you won't understand them anyway. The positives this game has: Nice sense of vastity, (although the Erdtree sometimes changes location based on where you are). Improved mechanics from the last games. OK combat I guess, if you don't play on PC that is. Doesn't bring anything new to the table except that even if you don't give a damn about your game, you can achieve huge success when hiring famous people.",0.3

"As close to a 10/10 game as I’ve played in years, I never liked Dark Souls as it seemed needlessly hard but I really wanted to give this game a try.

The size, scope and attention to detail in this world is truly incredible, you can run in any direction and run in to something incredible. It is tough, challenging, dark and downright infuriating at times, and it is a bloody masterpiece.

"A fantastic game overall and a very unique take on the open-world action-RPG genre. That said, I do not believe this game was well optimized for next-gen consoles, especially the PS5 in particular. This was the only game I voluntarily played in quality mode (30fps) for a majority of the experience due to the semi-frequent frame drops, and I'm spoiled rotten by high framerates. Also, I would've loved to see the DualSense's features involved a little more in the experience, a la Demon's Souls, such as the adaptive triggers and more haptics. Although I can't ignore how well the SSD works in loading a massive game like this lightning-fast, which especially makes (frequently) dying feel far less of a chore, albeit with some major pop-in every now and then. Nonetheless, the gameplay and design of the game itself are nothing short of amazing and very smartly designed, although I can name a few bosses which relied a bit too heavily on RNG and luck to properly manage (e.g. a certain endgame boss's snow attack, and a gank boss in a mid-late game underground area of Limgrave). I also LOVE how forgiving the checkpoints are before most bosses and major encounters, which IMO, is a massive improvement from past Souls games, especially DeS. Nonetheless, like a majority of people, I strongly recommend this game for Soulsborne newcomers or those who found the past FromSoft games too challenging, but still, know what you're getting into and as everyone says: git gud.",0.8999999999999999
"Elden Ring is an RPG that builds on the from soft formula that they have been building for years. Although this instalment does not drastically change the gameplay, the additions to the mechanics and improvement of aesthetics are more than welcome. Elden Ring at it's best is an incredible action RPG that does not forget what roleplaying means. You can start the game as whoever you want, and that doesn't restrict who you can become in any way. Quest-lines give you choice in a way not seen in the dark souls series prior. The open world is non-restrictive and the land is intricately connected to the lore and the history that has been built to give you an idea of the care and detail that has been built for this game. The lore and the world have been so intertwined that learning something about the lore will 9 times out of 10 add to your ability to play the game. The difficulty and freedom, however, are not for everybody. This means that many of the characteristics that are purposefully part of the game may be seen as bad, or aversive to many who don't click with the gameplay, freedom, or storytelling. Although everyone's likes and dislikes are valid, this does mean that this game is not for all audiences. This is perfectly ok though, as it does not take away from what has been accomplished in the release of this game.",1.0

I personally believe that this is the new best adventure game ever made there are flaws like some bosses just being lazy but the rest of the game makes up for those flaws the shear amount of content is unbelievable.

"Can''t tell how disappointed I am with this game, despite it is not fun most of the time I played this it til the very end to try giving it chance but after seeing zero improvement in gaming experience I just decided to delete it without finishing it, its too boring to play this game with a story of no weight and random repetitive boss that just randomly one-shot you from time to time. Not a single second I am feeiing this is a fromsoftware game, they never design such one-shot kill system in the past but in this game its everywhere, fully reflecting they just didn't spend much time to balance the difficulty settings, which considered they already had so many boss almost direct copy and paste from previous dark souls game, is beyond acceptable. The combat mechanics is also bad that its simply not fun and not challenging but totally unfair, not withstanding the fact that lagging and unresponsive input that is hardly accpetable as a ps5 game (I finished nioh2 with platinum so dun argue with me I am not good enough, this is simply not a well designed and configured game). I dun know how anyone could put higher than 6 in this game. The only thing perhaps make ppl think this is good game is probably we haven't had a fully open world ARPG game like skyrim for too long. But dun get me wrong, this is no skyrim and I would say skyrim in many cases is even more challenging than this game. This game is just a joke.",0.0

The goal of this game is not to rush through the main path, but to explore the beautiful and HUGE open world with its‘ secrets and side content. I have played for 78 hours now and have beaten 4 major Bosses and i still have a lot to discover. Gameplay is also just 10/10 with its‘ variety auf playstyles und different Bosses.

"I'm usually more of a platformer girly (Crash Bandicoot, The Messenger, Celeste), and this is my first time trying a fromsoftware game, but I loved every bit of it. I put 168hrs into it to do a lot of the questlines, do several of the evergaols, explore most of each area, and beat all of the main bosses and most of the harder extra bosses (including Malenia!). Despite having no experience with these types of games, I found it very accessible. I refused to get help with the bosses (my husband is a big fromsoft fan and a seasoned souls player, so he offered many times to help lol), so I worked through those fights on my own, and I found it so rewarding to learn the boss moves and finally beat a boss I had been working on for a while.

"This is best game I have ever played. For context, if there is an easy. mode, I will absolutely take it, so learning how to overcome this game (and platinum it) was a new and rewarding experience for me. I loved the process: I had to get stuck, pivot, research, explore and ultimately get better. Then I could take on that boss who was so terrifying before. Its so satisfying discovering the right strat for you. Visually and narratively, I found it imaginative and immersive. I loved that the tree would subconsciously guide you to where you need to go. I felt like the characters would just give you enough to go on to peak your curiosity about their quest lines although saying this, I don’t know how I could have completed all of them without guides. I don’t think thats a bad thing, I love doing the research and it’s been fun to watch how other players solve the various narrative puzzles. I really loved the fact that I didn't feel like the game designers weren’t telling me exactly what to do, how to behave and what to think - like so many games nowadays do. I find that to be so patronising and just…yucky… so for me I didn’t feel like they were inserting themselves or their political messages into my time of escapism. So hiphiphooray for that! I love that every NG+ presents itself with a new opportunity to experience the game differently- a new strat, a new build, a respec, more items to find, a different ending to aim for. I haven’t even spent much time in multiplayer, so that’s something I want lto try next, but only after Sekiro! Overall, it’s a rewarding a high quality gaming experience. Thanks Miyazaki and team for all the hard work and love put into it!",1.0

"After over 100 hours of gameplay and a platinum trophy, I'd say this is an excellent game, though not quite as legendary as some of From's own previous titles. However, this is the most accessible and simply fun game From Software has made. There is more variety is weapons/items than ever, and it is easier than Bloodborne/Sekiro/Dark Souls that came before. I truly don't understand the difficulty complaints. The game is hardest at the beginning, but gets progressively easier as you continue. I probably died about 10 times in my first playthrough, and I'd say I'm about average skill level. Elden RIng gives you more opportunity to overcome challenges through clever use of the tools available to you than any previous From Software game. There are creative damage buffs, spirit ashes, enemy weaknesses, etc. The game is easy after you get the mimic spirit ash. If you're feeling overwhelmed by an area, you probably need to go somewhere else first that will be easier. Last thing I'll say is that this game is a lot more enjoyable if you try to relax and avoid a completionist mindset, which can be exhausting given the open-world structure.",0.8999999999999999

"Possibly the best open world game I've played, the world is interesting and is one of the few games that I would gladly watch a lore video on, the limits for builds is basically nonexistent and you can center around whatever, a specific stat, spell, Ash of war, or making a weapon as good as possible, the story is fascinating and the characters you can interact with are often somewhat sympathetic though many of their questlines end rather tragically. The bosses are unique and difficult to fight even early game and while many bosses are used multiple times it isn't as negative as it is made out to be due to the sheer size of the world and how unlikely it is for you to see everything and fight every boss. The weapons and armour are well made and have detailed designs, from the most obvious colours to the most difficult to see engravings. Overall I greatly enjoyed the game despite the frustration it often made me feel and I can't wait to experience the games that led to this masterpiece",1.0

GOTY 2022 and one of the best games ever created. A unique game tha needs to be experienced by anyone who calls ****.,1.0
"Elden Ring is an excellent game (GOTY 2022) and possibly the best soulslike ever created. What i really liked after 150 hours of playing and the platinum trophy is that this game wants and succeds on treating you like a clever person and not a dumb braindead gamer who only needs 2 buttons to play a game or watch 30 hours of cinematics or depend on QTEs in combat all the time. The game demands intelligence and imagination from you, from exploration to customization and from skill and technique to fast reflexes. I mean, Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne already had these things but now they are even better. The ONLY 2 reasons that hold it back from true greatness imo (9/10 and not 10/10) are, first, the story is almost non-existent and second, the technical side in general, both in terms of graphics and music/sounds/ost, could be better. I mean, i played Hogwarts Legacy and then came back immediately to play again Elden Ring and it seemed to me like a game from 2015 or something. Nevertheless, a true must-buy for every soulslike lover or action rpg gamer in general.",1.0
"Let's get this out of the way, Elden Ring is one of the hardest games I have ever played (only Sekiro was harder). With that being said, this is games overrated. The fighting mechanical are slow, clunky and sometimes non responsive. I'll admit that the exploration is great, one of the best games I have played regarding pure exploration. However, this game has a lot of problems. 1. There is no pause button, the game will keep going even if you are in a menu screen. 2. Odd reason but there are too many bosses and too many repetitive bosses. 3. The soundtrack is actually pretty mediocre. 4. The story is convoluted and honestly just dumb. 5. The voice acting is bad. 6. The graphics are alright but this game looks and feels like a slow PC game, not a game that you would play on a console. 7. This game is artificially hard in a lot of ways. By that, I mean that you're character is slow and almost every enemy is much faster than you. Another way this game is artificially hard is that certain enemies are allowed to harm you through barriers and walls (glitches that are purposely left in). 8. This game is chore to play. 9. You have to grind your ass off to get anywhere in the game. Overall, this game is just overrated.",0.3

"Being a Miyazaki's Souls game already make it better than 90% of games out there, i want to make that clear, but i got some problems with it:I think the open world adds nothing good to the souls formula, sure, we finally have a open world game with top-tier level design castles and dungeons, but souls-games already had that. On the other hand i think that being open world actually hurts some aspect of the souls experience, like NPC Quests, which were already weird and messy on normal souls, but now it's just impossible to keep track or discover it by yourself. Another thing hurt in my opinion is NG+ (a big part of souls-games) NG+ and FromSoftware style of NPC Quests are not designed for a 150h game, it's way too much. Being totally honest after a reaching like 90~100 hours of gameplay i stop caring about the game and just wanted to rush everything to end it, i was tired/bored of the game. That have never happen to me on any other Miyazaki's game.Another thing that puzzle me is what the heck was George Martin doing in this game? Cause the story is the same thing Miyazaki is being doing for 14 years... The lore is almost the same if we change Great Runes by Lord Souls.Also some open world areas like Montaintops, Nokron or Deeproot runs like sht on PS4, literally a power point presentation, the worst performance i have seen on PS4 so far, it's like Dark Souls Blighttown on PS3 **** good of the game? The main legacy location (Stormveil, Raya Lucaria, The Capital, etc) are excellent, on the top of FromSoftware level. I think a shorter game with just those would have being better.Bosses are ok, but there's a lot of repetition, tho. They got to fill those open world areas with **** of magics if that's your play style.Last boss looks cool, but is a horrible fight, it's a ""run and try to catch me"" game more than a ****, what i'm saying is: It's a good game, but compared to all previous FromSoftware Souls-game i have played (DS1, BB, Sekiro &amp; DS3) it's my least favorite.

I accept that you may not like it but everything is very well done... the checkpoints are perfectly distributed... the enemies and NPCs have an extraordinary variety and characterization... the gameplay is fluid, varied and deep... the only problems are some parts of the game that are slightly unbalanced and the camera that is managed quite badly in tight spaces... but those flaws are totally hidden by the quantity and quality of everything else... it probably won't be the best game in history as it brings a limited level of innovation and takes inspiration from other games (especially the previous ones by the same author)... however for me they did everything so well that I can hardly remember a better game than this one played in the last 10 years",1.0

"My first Souls type game. When I first got it I hated it cause it was stupidly hard. Wanted to instantly return it. Then I found out you can farm runes and make yourself a bit stronger. Seemed only fair since everything one shots you anyway. So I farmed a bit, got strong enough to the point where I wouldn't instantly die and had much more fun that way. I made the game fair for myself and loved every second of it after that. Now that I know how the game is I could probably play it without farming and still have fun since I know what I'd be getting myself into. The game is great, the world is great, it looks beautiful, and the combat is fun. Deciding between magic or physical is great. Play however you wanna play.

"It's hard to rate Elden Ring. For a ""Souls-Veteran"" (like me) it was definitely fun to play. But i can't agree with people calling this game ""revolutionary"" because it's simply wrong. Indeed compared with Dark Souls or other FromSoftware-titles it has an open world, a horse you can ride on and interesting additions like weapon-arts and ghost ashes. These Ashes are maybe the only new invetion Elden ring came up with. In my opinion the open world is way too big, and looks blunt at so many places. combat on horse isn't fun at all and dungeons like the most bosses are repetetive like hell. Seriously dungeons are the worst. Maybe 5 % of them are different to others and they all contain a boss we have already seen before somewhere. Anyway beside the justified critic (according to me) elden ring is a great game. It shines in common FromSoftware-strengthes: Character and monster design, beautifull environment (legacy dungeons like academia, stormveil castle or house volcano) and a great combat system with awesome bossfights. If you cut away 90 % of all dungeons (because they are all the same) and cut down the open world to a half i would defenitely say this is a masterpiece, otherwise it's a solid fun game with strengths and weaknesses. (8/10)",0.8
This beautiful game could have been a 10/10 for me but the awful combat design ruined it all. Sekiro made me think that FromSoftware is now capable of doing great combat design. Elden Ring taught me I shouldn’t have taken that for granted.,0.7000000000000001
"Очередной забагованный шедевр от азиатского жулика. Все те же проблемы что и в Dark Souls 3 и прочих поделок этой команды бракоделов : пробой оружием сквозь стены/колонны, искусственно замедленные характеристики героя (боссы намного быстрее, что обрекает игрока на бессмысленный гринд рун (т.е. потерю времени)), а автовыбор цели писала самая тупая обезьяна в этой команде. Завидую играющим на ПК - они хотя бы не платят, а качают этот шедевр бесплатно с торрентов. Вообще удивительно - ну сделали вы хардкорную игру - сделайте хотя бы выбор уровня сложности - все нормальные люди играют для удовольствия, а не для того чтобы материться от очередного босса который выносит игрока с двух быстрых ударов, пробивая колонны, не обращая внимание на поднятый игроком щит и прочие баги которыми кишит игра. Те дурачки которые гоняют в эту игру с утра до ночи качая персонажа всё равно не покупают игру, а качают её с торрентов (это либо школота которой мама купила раз в году игру и они задрачивают её до дыр, либо прыщавые жирдяи работающие курьерами/сисадминами и для них единственная отрада - играть в ""хардкорные"" игры, дабы в их бестолковой жизни был какой-то смысл). Поставлю два балла за хорошую работу дизайнеров. Программная же часть - дерьмо, а тех кто расставлял характеристики боссам - пинками выгнать из вашей конторы. скорее бы уже пройти этот кошмар.

"Reluctant about the possibility of poor performance on the PS4 base system I just couldn't resist in the end and I'm glad I did pick it up anyway. The game for me is a brilliant piece of work. It plays like a SoulsBorne game and is relentless because you might just venture in areas you shouldn't ben at or there might be strong foes in easier areas where you didn't expect them. In the graphics department the 'legacy dungeons' feel more detailed than the open world but considering the PS4's old age it's no surprise. I'm 25 hours in so I've probably barely touched the surface yet this game is making me want to get back to the game... just a few more minutes just to realize a few hours have passed again; it's just so satisfying. Not all good news though, for me the major drawbacks are the crafting system which feels like a bad designed idea. 'Lets gather ingredients and craft items you just looted in the world during dark souls/bloodborne play throughs)', another issue for me is the side-quest tracking.

To make matters worse, they have the same pattern with no variety at all. It is a constant flurry of combos and you have to wait until they're done attacking which gives you a small opening. It becomes a constant battle of attrition which is not fun at all and incredibly disappointing for From Software. The only saving grace is the world building is fantastic. I feel like they spent too much time designing the environment and not playtesting the boss battles.",0.4

"Elden Ring is about every bit as fantastic as most of FromSoftware's other Soulslike titles. The biggest difference now is that there's a huge open world to freely explore, but it's just one of many changes. There's of course the new horse gameplay and combat which is very fun, new ways to craft recipes and add signature abilities to weapons, a counter attack move which is incredibly useful for shield builds, and a lot of accessability such as control mapping. Similar to the rest of the Souls library, the game does share the same frustrating quirks like still getting hit through solid walls and the occasional bug or framerate drop (at least on last-gen platforms), but that's all outshined by the incredible presentation of the Lands Between, a place filled with so much mystery it's hard resisting the urge to discover and conquor everything there is to see. It may be too early to tell if this could win Game of the Year, but it's definitely a strong contender.",0.8999999999999999

If we are comparing games, this is objectively a 10/10. So majestical and mysterious. Dark cosmic horror mixed with open world medieval buildings. Different enemies, different locations, it just never gets old. I honestly don't know how I'm ever gonna play another ""Ubisoft like"" title again. The industry better step it's game up!

"Played Elden Ring for about 40 hours, I am at Level 74 and I will stop it now. The Magic everybody sees in the Open World, in its lore... the so called passion in every corner, i really really wish I could see that too, but I personally don't see anything of it. Which Lore? To me elden ring a generic, hard difficulty game that pretents to be more that it actually is. I don't get the Hype at all. Its buggy too, I had to restart several times to progress, at some parts there are obvious problems with performance, not talking about crashes. To me it  is a senseless loop of grind. And to this grind there is not even a payoff. Loot is just a joke in comparison to how much time you spend into the game without any real progress. With Level 74 I feel as weak as with Level 12 - yeah, maybe I should have gone for a Mage instead of a MeleeFighter. Maybe I should waste my time for something else. So naaww... Not worth my time.

I’ve only notice a few performance issues(graphics will jump in, 1 or 2 second frame rate drop, and a weird green line that will appear for half a second).

"Итак, ознакомился с данным шедевром от Миядзаки сана на ps4 pro. И начну пожалуй с минусов. Не лучшая оптимизация. Из критических багов встретил только зависания в деревьях при прыжке с лошади и последующая смерть персонажа. Фреймрейт в целом приемлемый, хотя просадки есть, они, как и положено, раздражают, но в целом это не так критично. О графике трудно судить ввиду устаревшей консоли, но если говорить о картинке в целом, то она целостная. Ну и конечно же художники постарались на славу, да это не такой целостный мир, как например дс1. Но и масштабы этих миров сравнивать не очень приемлемо, как по мне. Далее о геймплее, некоторое оружие поломано. Из того что я встретил это катана реки крови, которая у меня не получила бонусов урона от скейлов и двуручник гатса, который при улучшении на +25 и закалке на тяжесть выдаёт меньше урона чем при улучшении на +24 и той же закалке, при чем меньше как базового урона, так и урона от скейла(с другими закалками такой проблемы нет). Теперь о хорошем. 65 часов, выбита платина и игра абсолютно не надоела. Боссы, исследование, чувство первооткрывателя, всё это отлично работает, особенно последнее, в силу специфики открытого мира. Играть круто и интересно, билдостроение пестрит новыми красками не забывая об истоках. Прокачаны анимации и касты многих заклинаний(в сравнении с предыдущими играми автора). Нпц и лор, в целом похожи на тот же дарк, примерная концепция та же, но есть больше дворцовых интриг, что наверняка пошло от сооавтора истории Дж. Мартина,но в целом это новый лор, новыми персонажами и событиями, опять же, схожи именно концепция, а не история. Подводя итог, лично мне как любителю серии, игра зашла абсолютно, всё чего я ожидал от игры оправдал себя. Отсылки на берсерка, мрачная, неоднозначная история, упадок мира, неочевидные квесты и конечно же крутые боссы. Смело могу заявить что лучший dark souls это  elden ring.

"Elden Ring is a complete Dark Souls formula, this world is a great expansion, released version and additions. More boss, more enemies, more rage. It makes me wonder what's going on behind a mountain or on that beach when I'm navigating the open world. It adds a fun look to the game called Ashes Of War. I'm playing the game with Vagabond. Vagabond is a melee character with a sword in one hand and a shield in the other, but his sword has magic skill. You should make a more average character than this character. There are spirits. You can call them with you because of your mana. There are wolves, sorcerers, soldiers, etc. They are successful in gaining acceptance based on caution, not more product-oriented than Spirits. There is an extreme boss structure in the game, but after a while the side bosses are repeated. The main bosses are very difficult. My Friend is one of the hardest Souls-Like games. Very small-scale battles take too long to hit this incremental boss, whose combos are weak. This causes you to get very angry with your personality and alienate you from the game a little bit. There are a lot of technical problems in the game. Instant FPS, little bugs, long loading screens.

This is just a 10/10 for me. The game play is really good and I love the diversity in enemies and landscape. Graphics are great. Its not like ultimate extra detailed but it still looks good and doesn´t look like a ps3 game like people are saying. I haven´t run in any major glitches but I did had some really noticeable frame-rate drops really low I don´t have a system of how I can see what my fps is but I didn´t die because of it happening and it only happened once and they probably going to fix that but for the rest I haven´t noticed anything bad. The open world is amazing and I could just walk or ride in a direction and I would find something new and cool. I like the starting class options a lot cooler than before with in my eyes more different option. People are still saying it´s not more accessible but it really is. You just have to take the lose and go a different direction or if its a fight in the open world run to it with your horse get your runes and run away and then go fight more enemies and level. I really recommend but you have to give it a real chance because the first boss you see is stronger than you on purpose so you learn to go away and level up.,1.0

"I’m sorry, but a game releasing in 2022 with PS3 level graphics that constantly fluctuates from 30 - 60 FPS (even in performance mode) is unacceptable. Furthermore, even if we disregard the frame rate issues, I’m not impressed with the gameplay at all. This has easily the clunkiest combat of any souls game so far; I find the movement is often unresponsive, and the hit boxes are horribly implemented. I’ll also add that if you weren’t a fan of Dark Souls, this game isn’t for you. It’s effectively Dark Souls 3, but this time it’s open world. Speaking of open world, let’s discuss that shall we? The map is pretty big, and gives you a lot of freedom and exploration possibilities, which is nice. However, there’s very little environmental variety, like at all. It’s all a very similar bleak landscape that never changes. This would be fine if the game was linear, but, for a game that encourages exploration so much, it kinda makes it feel repetitive. Perhaps a bigger issue, however, is that there simply isn’t a whole lot going on in the world. In many of the reviews for this game (particularly ign’s), they state that the game has a lot of variety in special events happening in the open world. However, I found that most of these “special” events are limited to being ambushed by enemy’s. That’s really the meat of exploring the map, is being ambushed by enemies. This is alleviated somewhat by the fact that the game has excellent enemy variety, from both a visual and mechanical standpoint. Though I don’t think that’s enough to save it from feeling repetitive (especially considering that many of the enemies are recycled from past FromSoftware games). Finally, I’ll talk about the traversal itself. The main positive here is that this is the first FromSoftware title to add a jump button, which is pretty necessary for this game. Beyond that though, it sort of goes downhill from there. There’s no climbing mechanic, no underwater exploration, no flying mechanics, etc. Are these things necessary to the game? No. But for as much as the reviews emphasized the “freedom of exploration” this game provides to you, it sort of rings hollow once you actually enter the game. So yeah, those are my thoughts as of right now. I know I am very much in the minority when I say this, but that’s how I feel. I would’ve given it a higher rating if it simply had a framerate lock option (even at 30fps!). But for me, personally, I have a hard time playing game with fluctuating framerates (especially to this degree)",0.0

I purposefully died on some of the bosses in my first playthrough because I didn't want it to end. The secrets, the loot, the messages other players leave on the side of cliffs encouraging you to jump off for a secret item, which eventually just leads to an unnecessary death, the live ghosts of players playing in real time running around letting you know that you're not alone, the caves, the dungeons, the castles, and so much more that I do not want to spoil.",1.0

"I loved dark souls 1 and 3.I heard the great reviews of this game calling it the first half of ds1 combined with the base game of ds3 and open world of (my favourite game) botw, finally got it running on my pc and thought that this would be the best game I had ever played, it’s not. I am 17 hours in and just reached the Main atlas plateau and cannot continue.I will first try to sing this game some praises. I love the art style, graphics, varying builds (which I thought was lacking in ds3), the vast amount of weapon types, the boss runbacks and some bosses move sets, but I just don't like the game **** biggest gripes I have of Elden ring (in descending order) is the open world, repeating bosses/ enemies and the balances. To me Elden ring’s open world lacks the same charm as botw’s does, it feels like dark souls 1 but bigger, this may sound like a good thing, but the scale just exacerbates the flaws. In ds1 I always felt like I knew where I was going and why I was going there and even if I went somewhere where I wasn't supposed to, I could do or learn something substantial. An example of this is where you may find yourself walking to the graveyard and then potentially further into the catacombs like I did but it’s completely obvious that you don't need to be there because of the fat ass in your face staircase  leading to the undead burg Infront of  firelink shrine, in Elden ring I had no idea where or why I was going anywhere after Margit because of the massive scale and many paths. In ds1 it was either go to new londo or graveyard and realize you're too low level and go to undead burg yet because of the massive open world in Elden ring there are so many alternative paths that can be taken leading to me just not knowing where to go at all and not being able to perfectly remember the interconnected map like in ds1, there is just so many places to go yet there is a defined way you must play the game to open gates to progress ( unlike in breath of the wild where if you don't want to defeat the great divine beasts you can just fight Ganon and finish the game in around an hour if you're good enough which I loved) For me this makes it feel as if the overworld in Elden ring is just a facilitator to farming and levelling up but there are some methods of farming that are just superior to all the others so why not just do that. I also don't particularly like the ""if you see it you can get to it"" approach of the game, whilst this might be true like in botw , the difficulty of souls type games less incentivises me to explore that much due to losing runes but that isn't particularly detrimental to the explorational experience as I can just git gud or run past the enemies. The bigger, probably needy and whiny, complaint I have about it is that there are places that I don’t know how to get to. By this I mean that I will see something, for example the big mountain at liurnia, and try for so long to get to the top of it just to find out that apparently that’s a late game area and I can’t get there yet. So, what's the point of making it an open world game if I can’t get somewhere? This is probably a really nit-picky critique, but I feel as if it’s a valuable one because the constant ""oh I need to get here but I can’t"" situation is much more prevalent here than in botw or totk where I can just climb or make something to get somewhere making the Zelda open world feel like a constant puzzle, but the Elden ring feels like there are massive barriers. The repeating bosses also leads to a less magical experience when playing these games. Just like ds1 this game has repeating bosses but where the bosses in ds1 become normal enemies to show you how powerful you have become (taurus demon and Capra demon in demon runes) Elden ring just puts them in again and again. I am no longer put in awe of seeing these large spectacles of huge dragons or terrifying beasts that I can learn I'm just bored and want to get to the next proper mainline boss, which I do admittedly think (apart from some **** 1 shot moves) do very well, (Margit being probably my 3rd favourite souls’ boss after sister Friede and Gael).I guess how I feel about this game is that I was promised the first half of ds1 with the boss quality of ds3 and open world of botw but so far, I feel as if I have gotten the 2nd half of ds1 with the open world of Minecraft and a few amazing bosses",0.6
"Why should i sit on guides and replay a lot of time and waste time on empty running. DLC that requires guides. Wasting a lot of time replaying. I can't beat the game, about half of the players can't beat the game or run the DLC, let alone beat it. This is equal to theft. Games like this not about player's skills, it's about stupid learning timings. The game should be normal - smart, not lazy stupid amateur's product for fools. Why there is people that buy games on PS or xbox? Especially like this? What wrong with you? On PC you have 4k 60fps and all windows functions. Do you play on 30 inch? Don't you know that there are 50-60-80 inch screens? On PS and Xbox there is a regional restriction of access to the game to voice acting languages and even subtitles. I sincerely recommend that people read reviews where the ratings are lower than the enthusiastic “critics”, or even bribed, because they are real. This is already known and tested in the gaming community. Even on Steam there are a lot of purchased positive reviews. And there are players that simply like something in the game and don't want to look on the problems, they don’t think about fair gameplay, balance and believability, plausibility and common sense, availability to people, they don't think about you. They see only one side. If you want to know exactly what awaits you in the game on which you are spending real time, real hard-earned money, with which you could help someone, do something useful in life, then read reviews that write about problems. Today's games are not at the 10 point level. For example, when I give 10 points, I explain why and this is very rare and you have to turn on your brain and decide if it's true reason and I try to write all the shortcomings and problems. Moreover, take care of yourself and your children and not get caught up in the excitement of buying skins and any nonsense. The developers are not your friends, they are looking for ways to encourage you to spend money, they sit in the office and while you are playing with their toys, they come up with all sorts of tricks to make money from you with the most minimal effort. Let the players sit on the guides, why try to make fair, interesting gameplay.. And if you have a problem, they won't care at all they won't help you, so don't be stupid. Don’t buy games at the time of release, you can’t know what’s in it and at that moment it’s not ready, it may have a lot of bugs and it’s probably not optimized.",0.0

The story is intriguing, although I found it challenging to fully grasp without watching lore videos or using guides. The only downside was the Malenia fight, which felt impossible for my character. After many attempts, I got frustrated and ended up finishing the game using the mimic tear after beating her and the last three bosses. That fight really dampened my experience, but overall, Elden Ring is still a solid 10 out of 10 for me.""",1.0

"Elden Ring, the much-anticipated collaboration between FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin has taken the gaming world by storm. As a long-time fan of the Soulsborne series, I approached Elden Ring with both excitement and trepidation, wondering if it could possibly live up to the monumental expectations. What I found was a game that not only met those expectations but transcended them, delivering an experience that is as profoundly moving as it is challenging.From the moment you step into the Lands Between, it’s clear that Elden Ring is a labor of love. The world is vast and meticulously crafted, with every region telling its own story through environmental details and carefully placed lore items. George R.R. Martin’s influence is palpable in the rich tapestry of history and mythology that underpins the game. The narrative unfolds in layers, encouraging players to explore and piece together the intricate puzzle of the world’s past and present. This method of storytelling, a hallmark of FromSoftware’s games, reaches new heights here, blending mystery with revelation in a way that is deeply satisfying.Elden Ring’s gameplay is a masterful evolution of the Soulsborne formula. The combat is as tight and demanding as ever, requiring precision, strategy, and adaptability. What sets Elden Ring apart is its open-world design, which offers unprecedented freedom and encourages exploration. The addition of the Spectral Steed, Torrent, transforms traversal, allowing players to cover vast distances swiftly and engage in mounted combat. This innovation adds a dynamic layer to the already rich combat system, making encounters feel fresh and **** game’s difficulty is a topic of much discussion, but it’s worth noting that Elden Ring provides a variety of tools to aid players. The summoning system, which allows for cooperative play, is more accessible than ever, and the inclusion of Spirit Ashes provides an additional layer of strategy. These elements make the game more approachable without sacrificing the core challenge that fans cherish.Visually, Elden Ring is breathtaking. The art direction is nothing short of spectacular, with each area offering distinct and unforgettable aesthetics. From the hauntingly beautiful ruins of Limgrave to the eerie majesty of the Erdtree, the game is a feast for the eyes. The attention to detail is astounding, with every nook and cranny packed with secrets waiting to be **** audio design is equally impressive. The score, composed by Yuka Kitamura and Tsukasa Saitoh, perfectly complements the game’s atmosphere, ranging from hauntingly melancholic to triumphantly epic. Sound effects are meticulously crafted, enhancing the immersion and making every action feel weighty and significant.Elden Ring offers deep character customization, allowing players to tailor their experience to their preferred playstyle. The range of available weapons, spells, and abilities is vast, providing a level of flexibility that is unmatched. The character progression system is intuitive yet deep, rewarding experimentation and thoughtful planning. This depth extends to the game’s NPCs, whose stories and quests add layers of meaning and consequence to the player’s **** narrative of Elden Ring is a dark and captivating tale of ambition, loss, and redemption. It explores themes of power, corruption, and the cyclical nature of history with a poignancy that is rare in video games. The characters you meet are complex and multifaceted, their fates intertwined with the larger narrative in ways that are often surprising and moving. The game’s ending, or rather endings, are thought-provoking and offer a sense of closure that is both satisfying and open to interpretation.Elden Ring is a triumph, a game that pushes the boundaries of what an open-world RPG can be. It seamlessly blends FromSoftware’s signature gameplay with a richly detailed world and a narrative that resonates on a deeply emotional level. The result is a game that is not only a joy to play but also a profound experience that stays with you long after the credits **** an era where many games are content to follow established formulas, Elden Ring dares to innovate, to challenge, and to inspire. It is a testament to the power of video games as an art form and a reminder of why we fell in love with gaming in the first place. Whether you are a veteran of the Soulsborne series or a newcomer to FromSoftware’s worlds, Elden Ring is a journey that you will not want to miss.",1.0

I had Elden Ring on my wishlist for almost two years, and when I finally got it, I was **** combat in Elden Ring quickly becomes monotonous. Once you acquire a good weapon, which requires some initial effort, you tend to stick with it for the rest of the game. This is because there are only a few truly effective weapons, and upgrading a weapon is such an investment that farming materials to level up another one feels **** game features a wide variety of enemies, but unfortunately, about 70% of them share the same moveset and slow behavior, making them easy to defeat in 2-3 hits.

"Elden Ring is a fantastic experience in a gigantic and very challenging world. It was the first Soul's like I played, a genre I thought I didn't like but this game changed that perception. The only detail that bothers a little is that some bosses are reused, practically copies and in these cases the novelty factor disappears and the battle becomes a little repetitive, but I didn't discount any points for this reason since a game of this size with more than 150 bosses It is difficult to maintain 100% authenticity and reuse.",1.0
"Elden ring is one of the greatest video games of all time and that’s definitely not an understatement. Elden ring is a massive game yet no area seems empty. Exploring through the beautifully crafted world on your first play through is almost magical, with so much to explore and an infinite amount of things to do. Tons of weapons and builds you can make in Elden Ring which just gives a huge amount of freedom to play the game however you like. Elden ring has almost a hundred bosses and their main bosses are just amazing. Gameplay is very fun and defeating a challenging boss is just so rewarding. Visuals are some of the best in all of gaming. Definitely a tough game but it’s one that anyone can pick up in my opinion and the freedom of being able to play through the game however you want is just perfect. Would recommend this game to anyone as it’s a perfect souls game for anyone new to the genre.",1.0
"Game mechanics is very simple. People think open world and nice graphics makes a classic game.  No.  Poor itemization, every item has little to no difference.  Too many useless skills.

It bores you to no limits because you will do the same thing a thousand times, and if you talk to me about the story, you must search in the Himalayas in order to know the story and its details, and the end of the game that I spent more than 60 hours in are just repeated endings from other games, and the method of playing that I do not remember seeing only in 6 Souls games are few, aren't they? no",0.6

"While I do respect the details and lengths made in this game, I find it quite hard to enjoy this game due to the combat and open-world aspect. Differences in difficulties could be very different: one boss could seem easy while one could be astronomically hard. Such imbalances causes friction while playing, erasing the sense of progression. In terms of being open-world, one thing that bothers me is the Lands Between itself is very cynical, with mostly enemies, dungeons, and forts on every corner. There are few friendly NPCs that I've encountered and they are mostly there either for the sake of the story or trading, making it seem more of a battlefield rather than a world.",0.5

"Dark Souls IV open world. The keys of the Souls saga are there: Greatly built bosses, enormous challenges, intriguing and dark plot, and RPG mechanics. It is great. I really like the gameplay, building my character the way I want and improving on the go. Constantly learning and immersed in this beautiful and sad world. Visuals and sound are spot on, the game feels great to play. I'm mostly always intrigued by what and who I will find and to see the semi-opaque plot develop.I don't like: It is too damn long, my full playthrough took 93 hours, and I was looking at the clock speedrunning a bit for the last 10. I also think it loses part of the souls charm in its massive open world, giving in to excessive repetition of challenges (damn you catacombs) and bosses. The greatest parts are its close spaces, the main areas where the big bosses are (similar case to the last metro game). Also, if I find a character and its sole response when I talk to him is ""hmmm"" I eventually give up on all of them. This is a major weakness of souls, obfuscating too much the story and quests to the point in which you either give in to the online wikis or completely ignore questlines. I've had a bit of both in this game. I'm okay with consulting a wiki from time to time to better make my decisions, but this is just too much.Summary: I'd rather have a semi open-world, featuring half the length of this one with the more trascendental and impactful moments and putting more thought in accessibility and better informing the players to help them take their decisions regarding build and quests. Great game even with the mentioned flaws!",0.8

"Elden Ring is a breathtakingly ambitious collaboration between FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin that exceeds all expectations. This action-packed RPG is an absolute triumph, blending the unparalleled genius of Hidetaka Miyazaki's game design with Martin's unparalleled storytelling prowess, creating an experience that is truly **** its core, Elden Ring is a celebration of the very best aspects of the Dark Souls series, while also pushing boundaries to deliver an entirely new and captivating adventure. The world-building is a work of pure art, with each intricate environment meticulously crafted to the finest detail. From the vast open fields to the foreboding dungeons, every corner of the map holds surprises and secrets that make exploration both thrilling and **** combat in Elden Ring is as brutal and satisfying as one would expect from a FromSoftware game. Each encounter is a dance of life and death, requiring precise timing, strategic thinking, and patience. The addition of mounted combat adds a new layer of excitement, allowing players to engage in epic battles with colossal enemies, creating moments that are nothing short of **** of the standout features of Elden Ring is its engrossing narrative. George R.R. Martin's involvement shines through, infusing the game with his signature mastery of storytelling. The lore is rich, mysterious, and filled with memorable characters that leave a lasting impact. The dialogue and world-building are Shakespearean, with every interaction feeling weighty and meaningful.Furthermore, Elden Ring boasts an exceptional soundtrack that perfectly complements each moment, enhancing the emotional impact of every scene. The haunting melodies and thunderous orchestrations add an extra layer of immersion, making every triumph or setback feel all the more potent.While Elden Ring is undoubtedly a masterpiece, it does have a few minor flaws. Occasionally, the game's difficulty can feel overwhelming, especially for newcomers to the genre. The learning curve may be steep, but the sense of accomplishment that comes with conquering these challenges is well worth the effort.",0.8999999999999999

"Dark Souls in an open world setting just does not work for me. I can understand people who like it in general, but all the 10/10 BEST GAME EVER reviews are just super fanboy levels of ridiculous, in my point of view. I really like DS games, but because they were more dense and linear, so a sense of purpose and achievement was felt throughout the games. And the cryptic NPCs were also alright and added to the vibe as intended. But all of this falls flat in ER. It looks pretty, but the world is dead and the cryptic NPCs just add to the feeling of being lost and not knowing what to do and where. Besides an open world, ER adds nothing new. Very bland, very rehashed, very disappointing.",0.4

"I think this is probably the best action RPG of all time as of now, and I say this not as a enthusiast of other FromSoft game. But the souls formula works really well in this open world setting, the character is highly customizable and there are a ton of weapon, weapon skill, spells and gear that  any other game pales in comparison.

GOTY 2022 and one of the best games ever created. A unique game tha needs to be experienced by anyone who calls ****.,1.0
"Elden Ring is an excellent game (GOTY 2022) and possibly the best soulslike ever created. What i really liked after 150 hours of playing and the platinum trophy is that this game wants and succeds on treating you like a clever person and not a dumb braindead gamer who only needs 2 buttons to play a game or watch 30 hours of cinematics or depend on QTEs in combat all the time. The game demands intelligence and imagination from you, from exploration to customization and from skill and technique to fast reflexes. I mean, Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne already had these things but now they are even better. The ONLY 2 reasons that hold it back from true greatness imo (9/10 and not 10/10) are, first, the story is almost non-existent and second, the technical side in general, both in terms of graphics and music/sounds/ost, could be better. I mean, i played Hogwarts Legacy and then came back immediately to play again Elden Ring and it seemed to me like a game from 2015 or something. Nevertheless, a true must-buy for every soulslike lover or action rpg gamer in general.",1.0
"was never a fan of soulsborn games but the open world of Elden Ring had me hooked. Its Far from the “let me grab you by your hand” formula I usually prefer, but I was able to find my way by following guides online. It didn’t ruin the “find it yourself” aspect of game, because guides only cover so much. You still gotta hustle to get to those places with the items you need. And even after utilizing a bunch of hacks I saw online, I hustled.I didn’t particularly like the overly challenging aspect of the game, but allowing me to come up with different strategies, which sometimes means going all over the map just to get one item, put in hours straight of constant **** game lacks a system that tells you what to do, which is good because it leaves the door open for exploration, however, without guidance, most players will simply miss on the best things this game has. Hadn’t I researched online I’d have missed on the coolest items and bosses.Anyway, we all know Elden Ring is a masterpiece and that’s it.",1.0
"For all the dark souls fans out there, the ultimate game has been made. And as for this being fromsofts first openworld-game, it's amazing. One COULD critique the random dungons around the map as a weak spot, but it feels more like ""extra"" than part of the main game.",1.0
"The difficulty level, a trademark of FromSoftware games, reaches new heights of frustration in Elden Ring. Instead of offering a challenging but fair experience, the game revels in its sadistic design, punishing players relentlessly at every turn.

Not a combat design that is very in-depth, just typical soul game combat I guess. Questlines are hidden and very easy to break.

"Elden Ring steals a lot from Breath of the Wild - and that's a good thing! The locations are spectacular, bosses are visually stunning and the design of some locations remain best in the genre. Everything is so massive, often even too massive. That's the one problem that i want to highlight - enemies and bosses start to repeat fairly early into the game, so I wasn't that excited to fight ""guy with sword"" for the 6th time,. The focus on the quantity over quality definitely had a huge impact on the bosses, that are one of the least memorable in From Soft history. Don't get me wrong - there are some really great mechanically complicated bosses - but I feel like that's not enough for a game of this scale.",0.8999999999999999

"I enjoyed this game so much. I have put around 300 hours on it now on PC PS4 and **** game is so open and you can try so many different weapons and magic combinations. It is really fun to just play different playthroughs with different weapons and because the bosses are so well designed you can play all kinds of different ways with them.This is my favorite soul game with the Boss design because you can stance break them and make that them fun to fight against.I just love using this spiked fist weapon , so I can use bleed  and Frost at the same time on the ****'s also because it is both strong and **** the game's biggest problem is that it's a  open world where if you are going for a certain build then most of the content is useless it just kind of sad to look at all There is and just saying to yourself.

"Когда ELDEN RING вышел в релиз, вокруг него было слишком много хайпа.Я не мог себе морально позволить порекомендовать ER, т.к. у него слишком много минусов.Основные, но далеко не все:1. Контеринтуитивное изучение мира. Ты не понимаешь куда тебе идти и в итоге сталкиваешься с тем, что в одной локации ты перекач и тебе невероятно скучно, а в другой - недокач и ты превозмогаешь.2. Данжи - помойка, количество наград, невероятно скудное. Это под конец игры ты ощущаешь как много у тебя всего, но первые впечатления достаточно фрустрирующие.3. Фирменная фромовская система квестов тут сосёт член. Без квестбука, очень легко забыть о том, что ты кого-то встречал, что он давал тебе какую-то наводку или прямо говорил что тебе делать. Отсутствие квестбука в игре с открытым миром - это рак.4. Убили ПВП вторжения. Не весело инвейдится в мир, где тебя поджидают 100% от двух до трёх игроков. А учитывая что у нас тут P2P соединение, это создаёт ещё больше проблем.Тем не менее, мне как фанату ДСов и любителю изучать мне - игра понравилась. Очень не хватает многих QoL фишек, что наверняка оттолкнёт людей. И пусть я всё ещё постеснялся бы её кому-то рекомендовать, учитывая как мало игр сейчас выходит - ER достойная игра, которая вполне вероятно даже заслужила свой титул.Жду качественных и наполненных контентом дополнений, которые всегда скрашивали все ДСы фромов.

The game came out in 2022, but the graphics look like they're from 2008. The combat is a flat out terrible hit-box based system that is overly simplistic. There is no difficulty selection in the game so for people who want to wade into the game and get used to it, that is rendered impossible. The world is lifeless and boring with very little indication of where to go, etc. It just assumes you're an expert at the game right from the launch point.

I finished the game with my trusty old 1050ti which is lower than what the game needed but it was really good for the card; I was really worried if I could even run it or not but it went out really well!(40-45 in open world and 60 in dungeons and catacombs indoor mid settings)Other than that the world is so gorgeous with beautiful art style and doesn't feel repetitive like most other open world games rather addictive gameplay with so much variety in playstyle; There's so many contents to enjoy with some of gaming's one of the best boss fights. (and also has so many repeating bosses that I didn't like). The gameplay was refined from all previous games from the studio. Finally, the hype was well delivered. Can't wait to play DLC expansion!

"I played this game in early 2023, and it was my first FromSoftware game. I really enjoyed the main story, although I had to watch a lot of videos to fully grasp it. Nevertheless, I appreciated the storytelling approach. The main bosses were all enjoyable to fight and had unique characteristics. The combat, while involving a lot of dodging and waiting for ripostes, still managed to maintain a distinct feel, although it could become somewhat repetitive at **** game's world is visually stunning, and despite the graphics not being top-notch, I found the art style to be quite appealing. My primary criticism pertains to the repeated use of bosses in the dungeons. I understand the need to populate the world, preventing it from feeling empty, and I'm pretty sure no one has discovered all the dungeons on their first playthrough. However, I encountered a significant number of identical bosses, even within the main campaign.Overall, it's a good game, especially if you're a fan of FromSoftware's previous works, and it also serves as a solid introduction if you're new to their games, as was the case in my experience.",0.8

The mouse and keyboard support for this game is abysmal. if they gave us better key bind choices for keyboard and mouse and not limit us to the controller style inputs of key binds this game would easily be a 10/10 for me. That aside this game is awesome I didn't finish it completely, but I **** at the game due to keyboard and mouse key bind issues and not liking how certain keys are pre-bound to other functions and not able to split those functions up across multiple keys is a buzzkill and makes the game to hard for me to play on keyboard as i kept mixing up functions that they do as directional but aren't directional on my keyboard.

"Fromsoftware just keeps getting better and more creative with their art style, but their bread and butter unnecessarily decreased in its quality and the difficulty feels powercreep’ed, which wouldn’t be a problem were the gameplay perfectly balanced. People seem to love elder ring, but the lack of balance killed the joy in mastering melee combat for me. In dark souls 3, the fast attack is low risk low reward, strong attack is higher risk but still consistent and special attacks were usually tricky to pull of, but very rewarding if used correctly. In elder ring on the other hand, most melee weapons contain an attack that is both the safest and very strong, ruining the flow of combat. Long gone are the days you interweaved different attacks, because jump attack/special attack is always superior.  From other complaints, the narration and writing refused to progress. Some people love creating their own stories off small environmental details and the little information we get and I respect that, but there is no reason for the more exposed narration like dialogues and cutscenes to be this mediocre. Some details or fragments are intriguing, but that is not close to enough when you try to have more of a focus on the story than in previous games. The flaws doesn’t make this a bad game, but fromsoftware created an art peace inferior to their predecessors.",0.7000000000000001

"This game is perfect! I give it a 95/100 just because in Lyndell, my Nitro5 was struggling to run at minimum. In Lyndell there is a lot of FPS drop and you need to watch a video to understand the history, its a little confusing. But for the rest, combat is perfect, exploration is perfect (man, exploration is not boring or tedious or repetitive, and each m2 of the map have something good especially items, weapons, sourcery or enchantment), price consistent with what they deliver, very good story (if you see a video because it is confuse), well-elaborated and difficult bosses (it's not that difficult impossible, it's a difficult that, if you are not prepared, you are nothing more than the boss and even so, you have a chance against the boss even without preparation and without equipment), THERE IS NO QUEST MENU!!!! First open world game that doesn't have a quest menu LOL! This is beautiful and the quests are excellent and you need to explore the world to do the quests and aren't stupid quests that is ""Deliver a milk"" or ""Take this for me, it is in the hand of the boss in Stormveil Castle"". To know about things in the world, it is necessary to talk to the NPCS and understand what they mean. Colloquial Brazilian Portuguese well inserted in the game, perfect translation with complex words that not everyone knows the meaning in Brazilian Portuguese. It's very good, I recommend tarnished!

Completing a section of the story and connected boss really makes you feel like you accomplished something in a way most games have lost. There is countless ways to play, with having definite differences in weapons and skills to choose from and so many things hidden throughout the world that if you don't use a guide multiple playthroughs could still leave you missing things.

"Overall a good experience worth the pricetag, but personally a disapointment for a longtime fromsoftware fan. After the release of Bloodborne and Sekiro, as well as some comments from Miyazaki stating that the studio would expand it's portfolio beyond Dark Souls, people like me were naturally expecting new and innovative gameplay. Instead the game meets you with the same familiar combat system from Dark Souls but in an open world with brighter colours. This has no right to be a new IP, it is even less discernible than Bloodborne is to Dark Souls. On top of this, the trendy open world coupled with a myriad of accessibility features (spirit summons, OP magic, OP status effect, OP poise, OP weapons, OP shields and just generally OP and broken min-maxing builds due to poor balancing, a hidden pause button, mixing flask physique, a horse to escape fights, fast travel, as well as the usual ways to help yourself avoid challenge like player summons, helpful items etc etc et al) yeah well that just isn't it. People used to say if you used 'x' or 'y' you didn't really beat the game, now there is a whole alphabet of crutches that you can use simultaneously that anyone who tries to brag like this just comes across as newcomer and a clown. Elden Ring is, for all intents and purposes, baby's first souls game. Clearly an attempt to cater to non-fans of their games, which works to make money but hurts your reputation with those loyal players. And here is where things cascade. The large amount of resources spent in developing this open world, that would have preferably been spent on 2 or 3 smaller, better designed games, result in lazy game design in other areas, e.g. reused assets, many identical bossfights, dungeons on par with ubisoft's outposts, an unnecessary crafting system, poor balancing, bosses designed around glass cannon builds that amount to: *lazer them in 3 seconds or be lazered within 3 seconds* and not methodical back and forth rhythm combat, and level design that starts off well but falls head first down a cliff of frontloaded and barren areas. All of these factors, especially the copy pasting of bosses and minibosses, leave a bad memory of the experience, and due it it being a massive open world game, I just do not want to replay it because I know most of my time will be wasted traversing the vistas. On a more subjective note, I did not like the tone of this game as much as any of the previous installments, I get what they are going for but its too 'vanilla fantasy' for me and the art direction is a little mute and washed out with the erdtree being an eyesore that casts the dreaded 'piss filter' throughout many areas of the map. Multiplayer leaves much to be desired in the way of covenants, seemless co-op and oldschool invasions, open world isnt effectively utilised at all and adding the arenas was a good call but the gamemodes are not well made. They did a good job expanding magic and making it interesting I'll give them that, although it is completely broken and OP. In conclusion, I never expected a huge and impossible game from Fromsoftware. The long wait and enormous hype generated did not even meet the usual quality standards that they are known for with their previous games. Instead our patience was rewarded with this huge hype chasing flavour of the month title that rests on the laurels of it's predecessors. Very unnecessary, never underestimate a company's greed.",0.6

"A game that should have never been made. The fact that this title is so successful has shown how sad the human race is. The game Is always punishing you because the whole uniqueness of the game is the difficulty. The open world feels extremely boring and I find myself frequently installing then uninstalling it. I don't want to devote my time to a game with crushing difficulty that might pay of when you win but who's got time for that. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE I LOVE DARK SOULS 2 AND 3 AND BLOODBORNE but hate this. Maybe cause From soft saw how stupid people have become and were like ""hey let's just make Dark Souls but open world"" GOTY? This isn't even game of the month for me. The game makes you seem like your in control according to its lame story but your actually not. If you love repetition and fighting in the same area a hundred times then finally beating it and doing the same at the next area this game is for you.

"Elden Ring was my first FromSoftware game so I came in without expectations. The game is extremely hard but that's what's makes it so much fun: Overcoming the challenges. Also there are a lot of systems which help with the difficulty like the spirit summons and the NPC summons. The world building is amazing. The design, feel, music and atmosphere are 10/10. The game is extremely immersive and invites you to explore. I really liked the open world without minimap directions. This is what an open world is all about: Exploring for yourself instead of being constantly guided from one quest to the next. Unfortunately though, this also leads to the point I disliked the most: The game tells you so little about what to do and how to do it, that you end up constantly tabbing out and reading the Elden Ring wiki or Youtube Videos for explanations. There are entire NPC questlines where you would never guess where to go next because the next location the NPC goes in an OPEN WORLD is complelety random. I think in my first playthroughj, I spent just as much time reading guides as playing the game which to me is just bad game design. You should not be constantly guessing, there are game design principles for a reason. The other thing I didn't like is that you don't really understand the story as it is told in an extremely vague way. As I said the world building is great and oozes with little details and lore, but for understanding the actual story you again have to watch a half hour Youtube video. So all in all it's a beautiful and captivating game which unfortunately explains too little. 8/10",0.8

"Amazing lore behind the game and good bosses but if you play the game blind you end up wandering around aimlessly and do **** all for 2 hours finding **** weapons and smithing stones that you already have hundreds of. Most dungeons are small with weak and **** enemies and minibosses that have been reused 3 or 4 times so that they can fill out a redundant number of 165 bosses. Also the good bosses are ""optional"" and there is nothing in the game that ever tells you where they are, how to get to them or how to activate it. 80% of your playthrough the game feels soulless and has the personality of paint-stripper with a side of a boiled towel. Yum. Most hype train shills will tell you that nothing tells you anything because its a true open world masterpiece and that you are actually free to do what you want because there is no quest marker and no npcs that even slightly hint at the next destination and how the arrows pointing around at the graces is genius because it does absolutely ****all.

The story telling may be not the best but personally I liked the story even when it was confusing to me sometimes. The only downside of the game is the pc Port but I can not complain because I have 3090 and with that the game kept running smooth but I saw performance issues on slightly older graphics card wich are still powerfull.

A differenza di quanto detto da molti haters, Elden ring è un capolavoro videoludico mastodontico, di quelli che ti fanno riappassionare ai videogiochi.

Oggi l'ho completato dopo svariati tentativi con il boss finale e il senso di soddisfazione per averlo completato è ineguagliabile.

do not mind the negative reviews this game is wonderful and one of the best of the year if not the decade I platinumed the game and I think I can give my opinion because I beat the 3 dark souls and I say that this game is all the best in the others improved I never played sekiro or bloodborne but I'm sure that elden ring is the perfection of all the games from it doesn't need a quest on the screen saying what you have to do you do what you want without a list and the best open world game in history until so in my opinion,1.0

"Absolutely unplayable garbage, and I don't mean the games technics. It runs fine. Rather the game itself is bizarrely overhyped garbage. Elden Ring is a game of pure power leveling. You absolutely cannot improvise or out smart your enemies, you are either at a certain power level and will win, or you are at a certain power level and will lose regardless of what you do. The enemies are all stupid mindless trolls that just repeatedly run over you or are crushed by you, nothing else happens in combat. It is the dumbest combat I've ever experienced in a game, immensely stressful in its stolid, simplistic stupidity. As for the lore and supposed great story with GRRM, it's a big nothing burger. There is literally no there there. Everything in the narrative is an anomalous grab bag of emo fantasy cliches. The imbecile nature of the game's structure prevents anything remotely resembling fluidity in the narrative. It's a great empty hodgepodge. Never before have I so baffled by the praise of something, not even mere videogames. This is the most wrongly hyped trash in history.",0.0
"Could have been one of the greatest FromSoftware games and greatest games in general. However, it is held back by bad balancing. In the early game you can make a build that completely breaks it but the late game gives enemies so much health and damage that you need one of those broken builds. Frame rate and stuttering issues on PC still haven't been fixed making the game look better on a PS5 than on an RTX 3070 even almost a year after release. Other than that is a game with incredible scale and even better quality. Must be good if I've finished it 6 times",0.8

"It's really hard for a game to get a 10/10... Elden Ring does everything right but I really feel like the armor designs are lacking as well as a lot of weapon designs, I also feel like there could be a wider variety of moves and combos for each class type (side note: classes are pointless). Maybe I'm just a noob to the genre but its important to remember that this review is subjective and someone else might love the designs and class system because as a whole the game works perfectly and I believe that these cons that I mentioned are all intentional from the developer, it just comes down to a matter of preference. For my first souls game I loved it! Trust me this game is amazing and all negative reviews should be ignored",0.8999999999999999
A very solid 9 but there are many reasons why it isn't a 10: Farming is complete BS and always has been. Some quests are once again very difficult to follow and you can miss out on great items because of it. Some NPCs have no purpose in some quests and are a waste of time. Crafting is mainly more farming. PvP is decent but there are too many one shot possibilities and mainly it is Ash of War spam and not much else. We have the usual happy Fromsoft mixture of some good boss fights and some awful. I could go on but overall it's still an excellent game and if you are a Souls' fan you will almost certainly have a great time with it.,0.8999999999999999

As you and Torrent -our mighty horse- enter the misty forest following a wolf howl you hear, our curiosity will be piqued each time by something else.

"Seriously i do not understand the hype of this game. This is just a mediocrity in all areas. It's trying to be ""hardcore"" makes it lack in every other areas. It's graphics are ""just ok"" for current generation, it's story is extremely shallow (a powerful item will make You a god, go kill some other gods to proove you are **** a nutshell). There is no worldbuilding as there are no sidequests, the world is completely empty, there are only monsters with occasional trader (wtf?!), the controls are out of this world. this is something that people should be fired for. Character progression and scaling is a joke, for 30 hours Youre a pigeon, and then suddenly you become a demigod, stupid as hell. There are myriad of weapons, which are not really unique, they fall into several categories and then they are the same, unless they have some special skill which completely changes how the game works, which is another stupid mechanic. I understand that some people might use this title to flex how good they are at difficult games, but this is just a modern Super Mario, yes, trust me, all bosses can (and must be) memorized, and then they are easy, exactly like arcade games from the 80ties. This game can feel really difficult at first (like all Souls games), but after hours of failing it suddenly becomes easy, where you one shot enemies and even bosses with some ""super build"". Stupid as hell. I finished it, but i suggest staying away from this game unless You want to become frustrated, it's not fun.",0.2

A lot of running, horizontally and vertically. Thank goodness I had help from the **** walkthrough, otherwise I would probably still have been searching next year. The side quests are garbage. The main story is irrelevant. But the cool thing are all the bosses, the battle system, the control with gamepad (GREAT!), finding new armor pieces and leveling up is great.

"My favourite FromSoftware game after Bloodborne. The fantasy and setting makes it like the Dark Souls games but grander and much more colourful. Boss designs are more inspired, regions are fantastic and the general enjoyment is pretty high through out. The sense of wonder in exploration is only beat by Breath of the Wild. Some tid-bits really brought it down for me though. I explored this tough dungeon till the end and once I opened the final door I got a curse which removed a character from the game for me. No more interaction with this character, and no heads up as I had missed the interaction point with it. While the character was not important, game felt very lonely after that and I stopped playing for good 6 months. Once I came back I was determined to break the curse that would have given me the worst ending and I did so, but this break in-between over event that annoyed me does bring the enjoyment down a bit. In a world this grand I wish there were more lines of dialogue. Malenia or whoever was your companion should have popped up much more often in my opinion or at least given us the option to have some extra narration on top. Similairly how the head is at the back of Kratos in God of War. I understand that it would break a bit the ""devastated"" immersion of the world, but still that's just my preference. All in all great game. Bloodborne's aesthetic and gameplay was better though, would be great if they made that one as grand.",0.8999999999999999

"It's a very delayed review because my monitor broke, but I see that fanboys and those who write reviews with money have raised this fiasco game to the level of unrivaled. Anyway, let's move on to our real unbiased review. Let's start with the mechanics as always, there is no innovation in mechanics, standard soul games, jumping is added and has almost no effect on the game. Open world was added to the game, but mechanically is there such a thing, the answer is no. The game is very big, there are incredibly many castles and dungeons you can visit, but they are all flat and empty inside. Let's start with the castles, when you start the game, you look around and see the incredible map and you start exploring, traveling and wandering around in castles that last a maximum of half an hour, yes, you did not hear wrong, the time you spend in castles is half an hour, including Lyndell! All of those incredibly designed castles are just images, empty castles with no design inside, filled with creatures and left. When I look at the old souls games, designs like DS 1 Anor Londo, DS 2 Drangleic castle are bigger and more detailed than all the castles in the Elden ring game combined. Ds 2 had this success despite being a half-open world, Elden ring is a huge empty world full of creatures. The only good thing about it is that it looks great artistically. I have explained the chapter and map designs together with the mechanics. Now let's look at the small innovations and whether they have an effect on the game. Let's start with the mount, we have a horse-like mount in the game, this mount allows us to travel around the whole world, we can do combat and boss fights in some places and it has no mechanical effect on the game. The things we do with the mount are very limited, don't expect something like Zelda or Shadow of the colossus. When I say Shadow of the colossus, they said that they were inspired by Shadow of the colossus before the game came out, there is nothing about it in the game. Since jumping was added, the platform was expected, which it should have been, but they didn't put it, the jumping mechanics look ridiculous even next to the games 30 years ago. Let's talk about dungeons, there are dungeon designs that are so terrible that they compete with Skyrim. You enter hundreds of dungeons throughout the game and except for a few, they are all similar designs. We have come to the end of our review and unfortunately Elden ring is not a good game at all. The same mechanics, open world game mechanics and design are not reflected in the game, nothing good except for the improved spells. Elden ring is the biggest fiasco of this year. 57/100 if we come to the score",0.5

But it constantly gives you options to overcome this difficulty. You can keep trying until you learn your opponents patterns, you can create a super strong build, you can use your summon ashes, or request the help of other players. It's a grand adventure and the sense of accomplishment after you defeat bosses is addictive. Beautiful game to look at, too.",0.5

"a masterpiece. It took me quite some time to finish it but didn't feel bored ever. I wouldn't place it as high on my list as Sekiro which is my favourite but ER definitely is high on the list.

Fantastic game worthy of Game of the Year. Other people that are rating it low do not understand From soft games. It's like asking a person that doesn't like seafood to rate sushi.

"It is NOT a souls game. What a souls game for fans of the series is? It is a never-ending sense of constant threat, claustrophobic feeling of imminent danger around the corner, sense of loneliness, a permanent maze-like feeling and happiness when finding a shortcut. There is nothing lake that in ER. In Bloodborne i wanted to open every door and pick into every window in every location, in ER i just want to the open world to end and find a castle, or a village or something to explore. Souls games are know for insane amount of details concentrated in average sized locations. When you transfer these details to an open world they are non existent anymore. Elden ring also lacks music and atmosphere. Do you remember the goosebumps moonlit melody gave you when visiting hunters dream in BB? Do you remember the incredible atmosphere in Sekiro created by music? You will not hear anything like that masterpiece in ER. Lets be honest alright? Turn the music off in Witcher 3, any Elder Scrolls game, RDR2 etc etc...Half of your joy and pleasure from playing the game will vanish. Creating an open world for ER (which is mostly empty btw) they totally forgot to add decent music to it and therefore no atmosphere is in the game. Bosses are dull, sidequests are almost impossible to start or finish without checking on internet, insane amount of items just brings confusion and does not really add diversity to gameplay. Overall it could have been a very-very good game if devs just made it 2 times smaller, removed fast travel mechanics (made us travel only from bonfires). And dear devs, please, stop adding grotesque British accent to every npc in the game. It really does not do any good to your games anymore.",0.0

"Yikes, definitely listen to the few and not the many when it comes to reviews of this game. I pirated this trash and still felt ripped off. The ""revolutionary open world"" is one of the most empty, devoid of life maps I have ever spent time on in my 25+ year career as a gamer. It literally feels like they had an entirely different company make the map and then fromsoft just went in and randomly placed mobs and ""bosses"" (since I guess we're calling anything with 500+ hp a boss now) and decided they were done. Fights are extremely lazy and predictable, I was actually falling asleep DURING BOSS FIGHTS just evading and waiting for my little windows to attack, which has never happened to me in any souls game. At this point I'm convinced the fanbase for this game is just degenerate weeb garbage people that have convinced themselves their precious cult leader can do no wrong, when he very, very clearly can.",0.1

"Elden Ring strips down the core aspects of gaming (combat, platforming, exploration) and hones them into near perfection. The result is a remarkably tight hack and slash adventure that provides near endless replayability. The art direction is often jaw-dropping, as seen both in the open world (such as Nokron and Liurnia) and in the imaginative menagerie of bosses (Ancestor Spirit, Mohg). Not to mention Tsukasa Saito's score punctuates all the dramatic moments and landscapes with a stirring, ethereal aura. The learning curve is doubtlessly massive and punishing. However, I found this challenge to be a refreshing source of fun.",1.0

"This is a harder than average RPG. It's possible to play with other players, but the bosses will increase their difficulty to compensate for the extra players. The trash mobs, especially when they have to be fought in groups, can be overwhelming. The interface is very complex and not very intuitive, so it takes a lot of study to advance your skills. The mood is overwhelmingly dark and there are few areas where you could enjoy a walk in the country with a friend. In any given area, difficulty may range from straightforward to catastrophic without warning. Dying resets all the enemies plus you lose your wealth unless you can make it back to where you died and then exit safely.

I play on xbox but I have also tried it on PC and although it gives lag at certain times it is very playable, the fact that many people say that many reusable things from the previous dark souls are used is because all the original ideas of Elden ring were from dark souls 2 and some from 3, since they couldn't be implemented there, they ended up putting it in Elden ring, but that's good, they don't know how happy I felt when I went through the hanging chains on the mountain of the giants reminding me of the DS2 chains of the mountain of dragons that I do not remember its name, it is a game that recycles a lot but that is good and does not ruin the experience, what if it is just the damage that the special enemies do in the final part of the game, they do too much and not even the heaviest armor protects you as they should, but it's a game with the best soundtrack I've heard just being passed through DS1 and majula from DS2, the fights are also original and good, those of the gargoyles that many You could complain, they were perfect for me and one of the best in the game and to finish...

Boss after boss. Pointlessly difficult combat, hardly any reward or story progression, because there is hardly any story to care about. Quests you do are meaningless and you forget about by the end, because there is no quest log. Awful game, overhyped by people who hate Ubisoft and think that now, Ubisoft should start making games with Souls combat, or some nonsense. Ironically these people never even cared for Ubisoft games. Ubisoft has obviously gone downhill in recent years and who knows, if they even make a comeback, but at least Ubisoft has solid selection of great games they have made in past and Valhalla was decent as well, nothing special, but still better game overall than Elden Ring or Cyberpunk 2077.",0.0

On top of this game runs like crap on pc (rtx 2070/r73800x) with frame rate dipping below 60 no matter ettings i used.

"This is the pinnacle FromSoft experience, from Demon Souls to Dark Souls to Bloodborne they have distilled everything that makes their previous games special and put it into Elden Ring. If you are only going play one of their titles, let it be this one. In my opinion they struck a perfect balance between modernizing aspects of the game and staying true to their roots. My only two gripes about the game is 60 fps lock on PC (I was pretty much expecting it at this point, but unlocked FPS would’ve been a welcome break from tradition) and the PVP being lackluster compared to dark souls 2 or even 3. The only people who shouldn’t play this game are diehard soulsbornes fans who won’t be able to accept that FromSoft is changing up their formula slightly, and people who would never consider playing any of FromSoft’s other titles due to the difficulty. (While Elden Ring was much more approachable than any of the dark souls titles, it’s still a FromSoft game - if you can’t accept that you’re going to die hundreds of times to a stupid imp with a hatchet you won’t ever enjoy this game). I’m not going full completionist with my first playthrough but I’ve already clocked 80 hours, and it feels like there’s still so much left to discover. 9/10 recommending to everyone who’s not a demon souls cultist or afraid of “getting gud”",0.8999999999999999

"After fully completing the game and putting in 140 hours, I think the critics nailed it, this game really is an open world masterpiece which is guaranteed to influence open world rpgs and maybe even open world shooters moving forward. The artistic, design, sound, exploration, immersion, combat, lore, enemy/area/boss/weapon/spell variety and size of the world are literally off the charts. It's also challenging while not being unfair and it gives you options to trivialise absolutely anything if you have no interest in the challenge.

"Elden Ring is a perfect example for the things running wrong in the gaming community in the last years. This game is by far overrated! A generic open world with problematic controls which let you die again and again because the controls cannot live up to the high standard the developers set for itself. I really cannot understand gamers which like to waste a lot of time for very less progress in a game. Are they all unemployed with no families or what?!! On the other side they blame the developers of a far more complex and more difficult to develop game like f.e. Battlefied 2042.

"During the first playthrough of the game, Masterpiece encourages you to explore the Lands Between. It is rather tricky than impossible to progress through the story while only defeating the shard bearers. Exploring the game and discovering new items that the game awards you for being curious, different ways of approach produce different outcomes that reward your craftiness. Defeating the mini-boss and the main boss feels satisfying while you learn their move sets. The map itself is an artwork yet unforgiving, you will traverse the land encountering new mobs while adjusting as to how you should plan out your journey",1.0
"As my first souls game, I wasn't sure if I was going to like Elden ring or not. However, after playing it, I can confidently say that this game is one of the best I've played. This is one of the few games where dying does not feel frustrating but fun. Furthermore, the game allows for huge playstyle customizability. On the other hand, I found the story to be uninteresting. In addition, there is no quest log, which in my opinion makes the experience of doing sidequests worse. Lastly, the pc performance can be laggy, but not to a degree that it makes the game harder or unplayable. Despite some minor flaws, I would recommend this game to even newcomers.",0.8999999999999999

"The majority of the game is very fun and addictive but, and this is a huge but, the boss design and balancing is insanely bad, certain bosses are made to be roadblacks that must be faced, there are some that actually punish you for not cheesing them, there are loads that are way too aggressive so they literally leave no room to get an attack in and some builds will have no way to counter them until after they somehow beat the boss. There are a lot of places where you will, without warning, end up teleported and stuck, unable to level up, reallocate flasks, upgrade anything, so you can end up losing your save if you get sent in unprepared which goes against exploration because there is no way of knowing when or if you're strong enough without entering and then you can't leave. There is a lot of that and it really ruins the experience and flies in the face of the ""dust yourself off and try again"" appeal of these games when a lot of bosses actually have nothing to do with skill, if you have the wrong build, you just may not be able to react fast enough to do anything without being killed as a result, you went caster? Tough luck, you literally have no time to charge your spells. You went tanky with a shield? Tough luck, this boss does a room length piercing attack that will stagger through the best gear available until after them and then they go into a one shot combo before you can control your character again and they patched out one early material could have let you upgrade one gear piece, like your shield, so you wouldn't stagger, could dodge the combo and then punish but instead we have this because boss design and balancing ****. The fact even diehard players went after the material because without that upgraded piece, some builds could not beat the boss blocking them from progessing the story and accessing other areas, or at least would require such perfect play, it's beyond what even a Souls style game can realistically ask. In summary, the good is very good but the bad will make this game literally unbeatable for a lot of people.",0.6

Being an avid souls fan, this game was truly a love letter for me. Venturing into the genre of an open world game must have been challenging, but FromSoft has proved yet again that love for one's work will always leads to successful results. This game does not hold your hands at all. After completing the tutorial, the player is immediately pushed into a world full of  epic vistas and exhilarating challenges that, once completed provide a sense of grandeur and glory. This adventure towards becoming the Elden Lord will truly be a beautiful journey provided that you stick with it even when the obstacles seem immovable. Truly a must play.",1.0

"Let me start by saying that I platinumed all previous SoulsBorne games, and I really wanted to like this game. The first areas are great, you can explore, there are dungeons, bosses and secrets, but it gets stale really quick unfortunately. The first area is by far the most interesting part of the open world, after that it takes a huge dip in quality (late game areas almost made me uninstall the game, and not because of difficulty but for lack of interest) I know bare and depressing atmosphere is their thing, but it doesn't work in an open world setting, the combat is great and varied with the addition of weapons arts, but it seriously lacks balance; it's extremely easy to make an OP build that renders most bosses a joke. the lore is legit dark souls copy pasted. yeah I know that may not be a bad thing for some, but when they said they are done with dark souls and wanted to create something new, I thought they meant it.. And finally, and what really triggered me was the side quests, the system in the previous games was always stupid, as you couple easily fail a questline simply by doing something before talking to some NPC you didn't even notice, although that was more or less tolerable as the game was somewhat linear, but stick with the same quest system in a huge open world where you are MEANT to explore new areas in no particular order is beyond silly. Overall, I think this was a failure and it's better they avoid open world games in the future if they can't actually fill their world with something interesting, not going to even address the optimization...",0.6

"The sheer amount of content that this game has is absolutely mind-blowing. Definitely a modern-day masterpiece. The gameplay is top-tier, which doesn't hold your hands through the fights, and forces you to actually get skilled enough to be able to beat your opponents, since you get punished every time you make mistakes (which is absolutely intended, as it makes you learn from them to make you better). The open-world is one of the best ever created, which gives you freedom to do whatever you please and approach the story and side-quests in whichever order you want. The visuals are pretty breathtaking as well. Definitely not perfect though, with clunky and poor jump mechanics, and a few bugs, glitches and exploits here and there, which hopefully will get fixed in the later updates.",1.0

And this is all on top of PVP and cooperative play that I’ve barely been able to scratch the surface of. Throughout it all, while the fundamentals of combat haven’t changed much from what we’ve seen before, the enormous variety of viciously designed enemies and the brutal but surmountable bosses have brought its battles to a new level. Even with all the threads, I didn’t manage to tug on my first playthrough (of what I’m sure will be several), what I was treated to can easily be held amongst the best open-world games I’ve ever played.",1.0

"This game completely encapsulates everything that FromSoft have been incorporating into their games from the start. The game offers challenge after challenge while giving the players multitudes of different ways to approach each one. There is a large variety in play styles that simply could not have existed in past titles such as: stealth play, horseback combat, and jumping with aerial attacks. This step forward in the souls formula also introduces exploration on a whole new level. For the first time a FromSoft game is completely open world. The only time you will see a loading screen after booting the game up is during teleports and after each assured death. The world is vast and beautiful, full of hidden secrets, and littered with enemies and bosses to fight for some sweet loot or that dopamine dump that we all search for when overcoming such great challenges. This has been my favorite entry into the SoulsBorne franchise and I hope that this game can show the other AAA studios and publishers that making games more about set pieces and holding our hands with constant markers and unimportant dialogue only serve to create uninspired and boring worlds. Just because games are getting larger does not mean that they are getting better. A small environment with a lot to feel invested in makes for a much better experience than a massive world with nothing but busy work. FromSoft have seemingly taken this concept and turned a massive world into a wonderful experience by adding multitudes of activities and places for us to invest our time and efforts into.",1.0

"Please read all of this before downvoting. This generation of gaming as a whole has been killed by the tryhards and greed. If you want the truth this game reflects a lot that is wrong with this generation of gaming. Cheap flights of sweaty mechanics like dodge rolling, parry, and jumping. Fanboys are a big problem with games as well. They defend it being a sweaty game as an excuse to (get good) but it is so hypocritical because these are the same gamers crying multiplayer games are too sweaty. The problem isn't the difficulty it's the game and this generation. The game really isn't that hard or even takes much skill to beat. It's just cheap and unfair combat. All just one hit kills with cartoonish animations with a slight delay so if you dodge roll it hits you anyways. It's just frustrating not hard or even takes skill to beat it. It just takes patience and mental health loss to beat it. This is reflected in this generation of gamers in multiplayer as well ( Jumping and dashing and cheap tactics to win). That is why no one likes multiplayer games. Multiplayer games die in less than a few months because no one likes playing against unfair AI or players. This is what divides this generation in gaming because they are hypocrites and want to call games competitive and a sport but don't want rules or sportsmanship in games and want to use exploits and use cheap tactics to win like (scuff controllers, dashing, and jumping). There is a reason why sports have rules like football and basketball to prevent ppl from cheating and exploiting in unfair (AI or players) ways to win and be un-sportsman-like. If it is a sport and it's all about the competition then get rid of cheap tactics/boss fights, exploits, and unfair fights and make some rules. If it is not a sport then why are we making games so tedious and playing like our lives depend on them? ( I beat the game on new game plus and level 167) but I had no other games to play and wanted to give it a fair shot). I feel like I gave this review a good score for how I feel and others feel. It is a mixed review for a sweaty game that could have been great if they focused more on the performance and RPG and toned down the sweaty feel of the game.

"As a long fan of the Souls-born series, this game feels so much like a best of tour. Some of the best, most grandiose bosses the series has to offer, the best weapons and spell variety in the series and does enough to make the game feel new and fresh with the dedicated jump button and the new ashes of war mechanics. Despite the rough launch performance wise the game has very much stabilized and stutters are really only noticed in the open world, not so much boss arenas and legacy dungeons. The game is also the most accessible in the series, as summoning ashes are plentiful, and the open world allows for exploration and leveling before tackling the bosses. I will admit, some of the mini-bosses in the open world and catacombs/caves are really just there to fill the run time, but some of these encounters are quite rewarding none the less. Also highly recommend using a controller because the game isn't exactly made with PC controls in the forefront.",1.0

"Elden Ring as a whole may seem charming and inviting on the outside, but I implore every single person who has ever thought about buying this game to save yourself the effort, and dont. I have played all the way to the final boss of the game, and didnt have fun at all, for the whole experience. It's slow, clunky, and overall just not fun. Oh and it stutters to hell and back on pc. 0/10 game, would refund again. It's way too unforgiving to new players to the souls genre. And I'm saying that as someone who isnt, it's too hard, unfun, and it will completely ruin your mood every time you play it.",0.0

"Piores bosses designs da fromsoftware até agora, péssimos balanceamentos, input delay pra qualquer comando, e imput readin absolutamente artificial, é ridículo. O personagem desse jogo é de ds2 de tao lento, e  os inimigos no jogo tem dinamica de bloodborne. Bosses impuníveis, com combos quase infinitos, e hps e dano gigantes, elden ring nem precisaria de ng+. Metade dos equipamentos do jogo sao descartáveis, e a idiotice de sumonar npcs pra ajudar, é de longe, a maior confirmação do quao péssimamente desenvolvido as boss fights desse jogo sao, necessitando de terceiros para criar aberturas em bosses mal planejados, esquisitamente animados acarretando em hitboxes bugados. O jogo não passa de hype mesmo, e se os nerfs pra tudo que é minimamente útil no jogo acontecerem... nem quero ver. Tirando isso, a exploração é boa, e o art design é legal também. As quests sao uma bosta, em resumo, nao se faz nada e morre todo mundo. E jornalista tem probleminha, ou pagaram uma grana legal pra eles. Sem falar no pc port, um lixo absoluto.

I love this game. it runs nearly flawlessly on PC however the game doesn't tell you the controls and the default ones for mouse and keyboard are not great. I fixed this within five minutes by checking what people recommended you change the keybindings to with a quick google search. the world is beautifully crafted and some areas are genuinely scary if you're under-leveled and it's able to let you explore but still sort of advise you to stay in the starting section. if you do choose to risk it and adventure you can get some really fantastic rewards. the message system is a little weird and is mostly trolling but sometimes it's helpful and doesn't really take away from the experience. overall the world reminds me of botw and so does a lot of the experience. if you are uncultured and don't know what botw is look it up and check its score on Metacritic.   :),1.0

Everything, from the dialoges to the menu to the enemy strength to level design is pure arbitrariness. This leads to undeserved deaths like (sprint button is also dodge button. Okay so far but when you hit and HOLD, the character still makes a giat jump backwards) which sure has cost millions of runes. Sorry I can not unsee stuff like this. It would be EASY to fix this by making the character only dodge when the button is pressed short and on hold the character goes into sprint mode (like in every  game since 2001 or so) I dont know if this is intentionally BAD game design or if they simply didnt knew better.",0.0

The general art direction of the game is nothing new or original but it has some wow moments and locations. And then, it has its errors: weird collision boxes only for the player, like when you hit walls with your weapon cancelling your attack (but the enemies hit through it and kill you) camera issues (during combat means you are dead), z-targetting just doesnt work, ""cheating"" combat mechanics for the enemies disguised as high difficulty, the world feels dead, unbalanced weapons/builds, and sometimes feels like an open world battle game instead of a RPG.

No story, stupid AI, almost nothing new or improved - friendly characters absolutely without any sense or action, you find them in some place and they say their two stupid sentences and stay there like idiots in same position till the end of the game. Enemies looks quite deaf, sneaking behind them in full gear is ridiculous. I dont see any new original thing in this game enemies are very nicely done but thats all, everything else was already here several times. Absolutely no reason to call this game of the year or give any higher score.",0.6

"Elden Ring is teaching an important lesson here. Hyped video games these days following trends, paying influencers and pushing unfinished products forgot that gamers don't care about battlepasses, skins, micro-transactions and other gimmicks. If you build a game with all its features at its launch, it works and if you concentrate on quality over quantity and listen to the community (i.e. don't treat gamers like idiots), the game will eventually sell itself. This is a GOTY and haven't enjoyed a RPG that much since Skyrim",1.0

"Absolute MASTERPIECE! This is a culmination of everything they've created, and it just oozes passion and competency! Considering it all started with Demon's Souls which wasn't taken serious at all and was expected to be a flop, Elden Ring truly speaks to the testament of From Software and their daringness to do something different and risky! It paid off in spades and other developers need to learn that playing it safe is why gaming has felt stagnant and open world particularly feels so samey and boring. Elden Ring has been fun to the max every single second ive played and From Software really knows how to engage the player and create an experience unlike anything! 10/10",1.0

"This game is not flawless, but it deserves a 10/10 for 1 reason: it will change the gaming formula for AAA games for years to come (as seen in current gaming journalism). It has an unparalleled level of quality for a $60 game in its graphical fidelity, gameplay replayability, total game content, character customization, combat system, enemy variety, music composition, voice acting direction, map size, map environmental ambience, map verticality, explorable locations, and i can keep going on. For the sheer scope of the game, i am not surprised that there were minor issues at launch. But as of the current patch, this should have been addressed. I've seen larger games in GB with far less content to play struggle to get off the ground at launch. It has a simple story, that it immediately presents to you, and does not shove down your throat. You may, at your volition, tackle that story at anytime. Or you may explore the world around you with brimming life, in a endless Valhalla like setting. It trusts the player to explore, and allows for an almost endless customizable play choices. If you take the time, regardles if you have gotten gud, you can beat this game. If you are an action rpg gamer, and you do not mind dying, this is the game for you.",1.0

Honestly the best game I've played in years. Unlike other souls games this is friendlier considering your not being forced in any direction.

Most of the people rating it low have no patience and do not understand great story telling and game design.

Elden Ring has an absolute gorgeous world to explore and it never feels copy paste like so many open world games. The boss design is top notch and the customization options are absolutely insane!

Somethings are hidden, so when you find them you appreciate the discovery. It goes back to roots when most games hand-hold you. Because the hard ways are the true ways and persist.

"Elden Ring has surpassed all of my expectations. The game is a perfect marriage between Dark Souls combat and Breath of the Wild exploration. To my pleasant surprise, Elden Ring was able to make world exploration the most enjoyable part of the experience for me. Being able to almost immediately unlock our horse companion makes the early game a wonderful time. There is something magical about riding through the world, enjoying the beautiful environment, and hunting for all of the secrets to be found. Again and again I was shocked by the diversity of world design, the depth of the dungeons, and the scale of the world itself. Elden Ring gives me a feeling that no other game has; the feeling of walking through an area with the sense that I've been here before.

There is so much more meaning in a game like Elden RIng. Just give your self a chance to try it. It is the closest thing to a DnD gaming experience, everyone has a different journey. The world is incredibly mysterious and rewarding, it's fair to say that nearly every corner of this nearly endless world has something hiding, something that most of the players could potentially never see or experience.

"Great game. Don't listen to most of the review bombs from new accounts with two reviews, the other being horizon. It's like people bought a souls game and are offended that it's a souls game. It's a classic souls game with a lot of the same mechanics from previous games. It's more accessible as there are usually sites of grace (bonefires) right outside the boss rooms.  You can also fast travel to any of them right from the start of the game. Being open world they have a lot of smaller side dungeons throughout that can be vested in 15 to 20 minutes but they also have those classic longer ones.   It's more accessible than previous games but the combat is in line with previous entries and in my opinion it's more difficult. There is story but like all souls game it's not something presented to you on a silver after. Everything has to be earned in souls games.  People who look at dying in a souls game like a failure might have a hard time with this as dying is part of figuring out enemy and boss attack patterns.

"i was thinking okay maybe fromsoft coming with a game for a wider audience will fix their hitbox circus and all the combat issues but no. theyll just convert everyone to weebs. it was nice in the begining im 200h+ in and i wont touch it again when i finish it. yea im bad at it but cheesing , relying on luck and rhytm games isnt difficult . its just for people who are willing to learn because they dont have anything better to learn . like i played it because it was the only game that seem good but i would recommend not to suffer through this . it was good in the beginning because of a few original tricks but after that it all becomes the same thing over and over but with more health and damage",0.3

"I have no idea what the other people reviewing this game are talking about.  I’ve been extremely disappointed in the video game industry in general in the past few years.  Nowadays, games are made to please investors and make the most money with the smallest amount of time and/or money possible (i.e. cyberjunk 77, battlefield 2042, recent call of duty games).  This game (Elden Ring) actually feels like the creators cared when they made it.  It feels like a work of art with years of effort put into it.  Its engaging, challenging, beautiful, rewarding, and surprising.  The only complaint I have is that combat is the main focus of the game and there is little content that doesn’t force you into combat.  This isn’t a huge issue, however, because the combat is technical and interesting and the AI is extremely well-tuned.  There’s no (or very very little) rest from combat in the form of minigames or side-activities.  This can become exhausting after a while.  However, this game feels like games used to feel - it surprises frequently with hidden quests, bosses, items, and lore.  The FPS drops have only noticeably occurred during the first mini-boss (tree sentinel), but other than that I haven’t had any other noticeable FPS drops, and my computer setup is mediocre, at best.  Do not listen to all the people complaining.  The FPS drops can be frustrating, but the game is highly entertaining and, to me, is worth playing regardless of the infrequent frame rate issues.",0.8999999999999999
"Elden Ring brought a new set of challenges which I was not expecting and that is something I can appreciate as a Souls fan. Performance issues aside, the world of ER is big and beautiful to explore. Lots of cool bosses which can be borderline impossible but leave a great sense of accomplishment. Wide variety of enemies and interesting areas spread throughout the game. For some of my less favorite aspects of the game, the crafting system is somewhat useless. I used it once to craft sleep arrows and that was for a very poorly designed boss which I won't mention here. The over-engineering of some bosses/mobs, which made strength builds nearly obsolete due to how little window there is to attack for the majority of bosses. Overall, this is the hardest game I ever played which is something I can appreciate. Starting NG+ and looking forward to playing this again.",0.8999999999999999

"Elden Ring é um jogo superestimado, ele sim tem seus pontos positivos, porém os negativos me chamam muito mais atenção, a quantidade de recursos reciclados utilizados nesse jogo é assustadora para uma franquia ""nova"". A questão aqui é que o jogo não apresenta na MINHA opinião, nenhuma grande inovação no mundo dos jogos. Ele tem uma exploração cansativa, que não é motivante, muitas das vezes não te da nenhum item que tu realmente fique feliz em ter pego, os inimigos repetidos a todo canto e com move set ou aparência reciclados faz com que eu sinta estar jogando os mesmos jogos que foram lançados já fazem 11 anos. Ter bosses diferentes, ou bem detalhados EU não considero grandes pontos positivos, pois isso é o básico, falar que esse jogo a vale o que é cobrado pra mim é piada, 97 de nota é piada, não adianta de nada ter uma baita história genial, contada de uma maneira ""inovadora"" se a gameplay durante as 60 horas de jogo vão ser enjoativas. Sem falar que a história é mais do mesmo, esse jogo se resume a preguiça.

"This is my response to people who say ""Well other than the pc performance the game is stellar!"" FFS reviews should be about the game as it is not potential improvements. Don't you realize this is the same thing EA did with anthem and CDPR with Cyberpunk????? I love From Software. I've been playing elden ring for 12 hour streaks on my days off, sometimes even more. But you CANNOT just casually say ""the only blemish in an otherwise stellar game"" about performance. You have no idea how flipping annoying and immersion breaking this game is when it trips over fps. I have adhd and I can hyper concentrate on details like that, and although I love the game, it makes me so mad at Miyazaki every time I mount my horse and my fps goes from a solid 60 to 33. On a ryzen 9 and 2060 setup on 1080. I can run games like this on 2 monitors with max settings and get over 60 steady. There is absolutely no reason why FromSoft can keep doing this to the PC community. Dark Souls remastered was next to unplayable for me.

There is no way to keep track of what you are doing and what you have done. Morbid, garish art. A non existent story, there's nothing compelling or engaging about any of it.. Gameplay itself is a horrendous grind fest, a mindless slog and rewardless git-guddery. The open world is graphically sub-standard (think software from 2013), utterly lifeless and uninteresting with often re-used enemies and terrible dungeon design. The UI is pure horror, game is massively unfun, and terribly ported. It's Dark Souls in an open field with a huge glowing tree in the middle - the ""open world"" is really just enclosed areas with individual sections, with weird creatures all just waiting until you get within range. There is no AI, just animals and enemies scattered about the landscape, step inside their attack radius, they come at you, step outside it, they stop.

And no it's not a ""git good"" problem, I've finished all dark souls games and sekiro, it's an optimization problem and Fromsoft clearly not giving a **** about pc gamers. The only 2 games where my pc started farting furiously as soon as they loaded are cyberpunk 2077 and elden ring and if you've heard anything about cyberpunk that alone says a lot. Even with all options turned down to the lowest possible I get 20-40 fps on 1080p in open world and these drop even more on boss fights. Not to mention the occasional stuttering which sometimes turns into death warrant. It's shameful asking full price for a game at this state and even releasing it at this state in the first place. Have we all just accepted that we'll be beta testing games from now on?",0.5
"It's a new FromSoftware game, but now without shackles to hold it down. The game is amazing, I'm 70 hours in and the game just won't stop amazing me. It's so much happening, there are so many weapons, the addition of Ash of war just makes the combat so much dipper, the boss fights... don't even get me started on that. I've beaten the main boss in the Calid Region, and boy oh boy... What a boss fight. I don't wanna spoil it but that was just the most fun battle I've had in video games.",1.0
"How can a game released in 2022 be this bad of a port onto the PC? If you cannot support comfortable and intuitive Keyboard and Mouse controls then at least make every control re-mappable. The Graphics and gameplay were OK, but not enough to excuse the stuttering and clipping issues on a PC that can run other new titles at max settings. However, the lack of Keyboard and Mouse controls were the deal breaker. Uninstalled and got my Steam refund.",0.0

"A must play. Do yourself a favor and don’t listen to the negative reviews from maidenless gamers who have been conditioned to need easy games, hand holding, and no thought. This game is not that. Most the the negative comments are explained by lack of attention to detail. There is literally a tutorial 10 minutes into the game. There is a rich story. There is a rich and beautiful environment full of life. The game has built on the successful gameplay and atmosphere from previous titles. Get the game, take it slow, learn, pay attention and thank me later.",1.0
"I have never played a From Software game before Elden Ring. It took me a while to get used to the gameplay and questing. After playing for about 30ish hours of game time I absolutely love this game. The open world, the graphics, the combat system it's all amazing.",1.0
"The game is a masterpiece, and this review is directed towards people who are interested but hesitant because of the negative reviews. While I have experienced, some performance hiccups, they did not detract from my experience playing the game. I do not believe that they will remain in the game given some patchwork. If you have bought the game and have issues with performance, I can understand being disappointed, but I urge you to get a refund and withhold judgment on it. Come back at a later time, because this is going to be a timeless masterpiece and it would be a shame to not experience it in it's fullest. Games are very complicated and pretty much impossible to get running perfectly for everyone, but given time I believe they will  get the game running much better for people who at least have the required hardware or better. This belief is based on fromsoft's previous track record of having initial difficulty with PC ports and the sheer amount of effort clearly put into this game. They clearly care. I don't believe the game deserves criticism for how it presents its story, or difficulty. Nor do I believe it deserves criticism for not having the highest fidelity graphics.  This is not the game for you if you are looking for a game that has a lot of story to ingest, or doesn't require much of the player in general. There is nothing wrong with that, people are allowed to have their own interests, but that does not make the game a bad game. If you are interested in the visuals I would argue that, despite not being the most realistic or being the highest fidelity, Elden ring has presented me with some of the most, if not the absolute most, awe inspiring vistas and visuals I have ever seen in a game. I would also argue that Elden Ring is a game that prioritizes gameplay (as I believe all games should but that is my opinion), and if you believe that it shouldn't maybe it isn't the game for you, but that doesn't make it a bad game for it's target audience. As for people struggling with the difficulty, contrary to what a lot of people think the intention behind the game isn't explicitly to be difficult, but rather to present a meaningful challenge that is rewarding to overcome. It is about learning and thinking outside the box. There are plenty of ways to make encounters more manageable, they are however left for the players to figure out. Being hard doesn't make the game bad. This game is quickly becoming one of my favorite games ever, but it's not for everyone. That said not every game needs to be for everyone. I recommend the game, but I also recommend getting a friend to let you try it first if you are unsure. Games are about entertainment so find a game you enjoy and don't be mad at people for liking a game that isn't made for you.",1.0

"I can't believe some of the people on here, they are just ridiculous! I made an account just to counteract the terror attack that has befallen this masterpiece ****. Shame on you people! The amount of work that was put into this game alone should be enough to earn praise, and all your negative reviews are doing is hurting the people who made it. These people are review bombing this game because of occasional stuttering, very occasional by the way, as I have 90+ hours already put into this game and just can't put it down! So people are angry about a bit of stuttering, that's no reason to give it a 0 rating, none of you are actually taking the game itself into account. I seem to remember another game that had performance issues due to its massive size, however it retained its positive rating and is hailed as one of the greatest games of all time. If course, I'm speaking of skyrim. To the people who want actual reviews, please use your brains and read some reviews, you'll see that it's really a great game, even made inviting to non souls-like players. No it does not have ultra wide support, but does it deserve to die based on that? Come on people, think a little. Also someone mentioned bad controller support, but none of the people I play with nor myself have had any issues with this, so I don't know where that's coming from. In closing, please be fair to the great developers of this game, have some common decency.

There are tons of mechanics that makes this game a true RPG, of that kind we are not used to see, nowadays. And the story, check the descriptions of the items and try not to skip all dialogues, trust me. Finally, do you really think that Forbidden West is innovative?

"Elden Ring its a Souls game, it won't take your hand and takes you where you should go or when you should face a boss, the very first boss (Tree Sentinel), teach you that you don't need to face everything on your way right away , you can go back once you feel that you can take that fight, Margit teaches you to learn and be patient with an enemy and the whole story progresses trought items description. While this may not be everyones favorite way of play a game, allows the player to have so much freedom thats amazes me. I've seen some reviews saying that this game graphics are bad or dated and to be honest I don't feel that way, they definitely aren't they best graphics in the market but they don't compromised the enjoyment of the game, some scenarios are unbelievable beautiful, going down the elevator to Siofra River its one of the most amazing places that I've seen in a game. I've also seen some reviews saying that the world is dead and that's completely false, there's a lot of things happening in the game, each area has its own unique enemies fittng perfectly with the environment.

The story as well, highly missable, highly optional. the difficulty is definitely a matter of taste but the difficulty spikes is just like the game itself: an absolute stumble fest. people enjoy the game, because the open world is EASY and gives the illusion of approachability, but for every new weirdly designed boss or miniboss encounter that euphoria drops into the pit of realization that this game just started throwing **** together and people eat it due to the established git gud syndrome.

"It’s funny to see people who clearly haven’t played anything more challenging than mainstream bait titles zelda botw, ghost of tsushima, assassin’s creed and whatnot, complain about a game that has a 10+ year long history of having the same solid mechanics set in stone. They don’t realize that the difficulty of these games comes from THEM being a **** player because they were seasoned with the titles stated above, titles that reward you for being a **** player. They are not used to challenges. They want quest markers, dungeon markers, npc markers on the map. They want a difficulty setting. They don’t get what “roleplaying” means in these games. You’re not playing as some killing machine that can crush every single enemy as if they were tin cans, you’re playing as a person who seeks to be that strong one day, and you DO become that strong come late game. I hate that this game became a mountain of hype. Sorry but, the souls series doesn’t deserve this treatment. I don’t know why they decided to open it up to the general, more stupid audience. If this game had the same fanbase DS3 had at its release, I guarantee you it would’ve had a fan review score of 98-99. This game is literally the closest game we’ve had to perfect in its respective genre. Sorry for the long comment, I just felt like they didn’t do justice to this masterpiece of a video game franchise.",1.0
"I don't even meet minimum requirements and the game runs amazing. It's packed with content and it's all good. It's incredible how big the legacy dungeons are, Stormveil Castle, the first one, took me an entire day to clear out 100%. NPC Questlines are very easy in a good way, as they're hard to find, but you don't fail them as easy as in other games. Hell, I don't even think I failed a quest yet and I literally beat the final boss. It's as close as a perfect game as it can get. it does have some flaws here and there, but it's compensated by the quality of everything else. Only thing I dislike is the last 5h of the game only because they're exhausting. It's like the final boss of Sekiro but for 5 hours straight with some breaks, yet not enough. Don't get me wrong, it's really cool, but it dragged for too long, and it's not like you would go farm somewhere then come back stronger at the literal end of the game, natural instinct is to keep pushing, it's the final afterall.",1.0

Elden Ring is without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my 15 years of gaming.

"An absolute masterpiece in my opinion, Game does have some heavy frame rate issues and a few crashes for me personally, The online has some disconnection issues as well but my overall experience with how good it is and how expansive and wonderful the world is to explore those issues that I know will be fixed don't bother me, I'm 50 hours into the game writing this and I have no doubt it will become game of the year and it's well deserved. It's sad to see the game being review bombed and given 0's over the issues it has or things like ""bad graphics"" the game is incredibly beautiful in my opinion. It's no horizon forbidden west which is fine, the environment and style do a lot for me fromsoft are in a master craft of world building and art style. I have a hard time due to disabilities staying with games I feel I'm not good at and I give up quite easily but for some reason I haven't even had to take a break from the game. I've gotten angry yes but something in me kept wanting to persevere and complete the task I was stuck on and doing so gave me a feeling I can't quite describe. It's honestly been great overall for my mental health which probably sounds crazy but finding out I can actually keep going and accomplish something that' seems incredibly difficult is amazing for me. The massive amount of hate I've seen recently for the smallest of reasons is saddening but it doesn't change how great the game is. The game is also incredibly accessible to newer players or people who had a hard time with previous games. Yes it's still very difficult at times but you have the opportunity to explore the entire world and gear yourself and power yourself up for encounters you feel you cant handle yet and it highly rewards you for exploring. If you're too afraid to try the game because you've hard how difficult it is, give it a try anyway I think you'll find a fantastic game.",1.0

"This game is one of the best open world experiences. Don't let review bombers sway your opinion because they can't handle something popular being good that they don't like. Yes, it's hars, but it's made that way so you naturally improve and eventually celebrate when you overcome the obstacle.",1.0
"Bad performance on PC right now and mouse and keyboard and mouse controls are not ideal. As for gameplay and graphics it is nothing special either. A rehash of previous games, particularly in boss fights, without much that is new, especially in regards to models and animations. I do hope this lazy formula is on the way out for future from software games. Ironically it seems the remaster of From software's first Souls game, Demon's Souls is the companies benchmark to beat. I would like to see something more along the lines of the first half of Dark Souls 1 with 80+ hours of slow burn and perfect gameplay, perfect graphics, refined level design and a heroic journey. No warping, big lead up to bosses and high stakes. Fromsoftware keeps nearly making a great game but is every time an unfulfilled promise. Dark Souls was almost this but the second half was obviously rushed. Demons Souls, Dark Souls I and II are still the best games they have made and FromSoftware is still to top them. They must take the best successes of all their previous releases and make something great. To me, Elden Ring is not this. The horse platforming is a kind of fun mini game but overall the open world is tedious and doesn't feel like you are really exploring anything. When the game goes back to the original dark souls style in Stormfront castle the game feels much better and after seeing what it had to offer, to me the open world aspect with a huge influence from Breath of the Wild, of the game is a big waste of resources when they could have been designing a much more dense linear environment. Fighting is overwhelmingly tedious compared to previous games and rushing past enemies to the bosses or checkpoints is the best strategy which seems like a flaw in the design. Killing enemies does not reward enough souls to make it worthwhile. Boss fights no longer have a strategy you can learn over time so you can eventually outsmart them and fights become a war of attrition and based on luck as opposed to feeling like you are actually fighting the enemy in a meaningful way as for example they were in Sekiro. Elden Ring overall feels like it is spread too thin trying to have too much content.",0.4

"The games stutters every few seconds, it is locked to just 60 frames per second, does not offer the option to change fov and the performance is far from good which makes the lack of DLSS/FSR even worse. Ray tracing is also not present at the moment of writing, but it is supposed to be added in a later update. The stutters are constantly present and they plague every system not even rtx 3090 and 12900k are capable of maintaining a constant 60fps at 720p. Behind all of these issues is a great game, but the performance issues are so severe it is impossible to look past them. If we put the performance issues aside, calling this game great would be an understatement, but the issues cannot be ignored. Heavily recommend, but only once it is fixed, if it gets fixed.",0.1

"The greatest innovations of this iteration of Demon's Souls are mechanics from the decade prior to Demon's Souls. Jumping, horses, open worlds. Wow, why didn't we think of that before?

It's not a new franchise, it's not a bold new direction, it's just red guys hitting you from 10 feet away and luring you into enemies again. This is like calling Quake 2 fresh because you have an inventory like in Hexen. There's no reason anyone should care. EDIT: Ok, bad analogy, it's actually like if Quake came out every 2 years between 1996 and 2009, and each time it had that room in Gloom Keep where you grab the gold key and the shambler pops out, only this time in 2009 everyone's saying that the shambler's ""art design"" is incredible and it's probably the best game they've ever played.",0.5

It's a slapped-on gimmick and makes Cyberpunk's terribly dead open world look lively.

"After playing through Dark Souls Remastered and putting in some time with Dark souls 3, I was ready to jump into Elden Ring. What an improvement. Being able to fast travel right from the start is a huge upgrade and the many checkpoints make exploring a joy. The combat is improved from previous souls games but more or less the same, so if you've played any of the previous games, your skills will carry over.  I will be putting in thousands of hours into this massive game. Great job again From Software. Thank you for this.",1.0

"First FromSoftware game I play. I didn't adapt to any Dark Souls or Demon Souls games because in addition to the already known difficulty, the linear world was very limiting. The open world in Elden Ring is amazing and rewards you for the time invested in exploration and grinding, even allowing for a mixed build. I started as a Hero and STR Build, I'm adapting to STR+DEX and I should put some points in INT and MND too. Note 10 despite the bad performance on PC (I have an RTX 3070 TI) and I hope they fix this and other problems soon besides releasing expansions.",1.0

I'm saying this as someone who never really like any of the previous Souls games. Elden Ring is my favorite game of all time. I would 100% recommend this game to everyone. I honestly never thought I would fall in love with this game so much. It's kind of ironic comparing myself today to myself a few days ago. Elden Ring is literally my life now.,1.0
バグや最適化不足以前に面白くない。OWで自由を標榜しておきながらあるキャラクターに合うまでレベル上げすることができない仕様になっている。それだけならまだしもこのゲームではデスペナで経験値＝金が失われるため、回収こそできるものの単純に面倒くさい上にそのキャラに会わなかった人はひたすらさまよい続けることとなる。攻略サイトを見ればそれもなんとかなるものだが、それで自由度を誇るとかあほらしい。,0.0
Easily one of the best games of all time. If I could give it an 11/10 I would. The bad reviews are just trolling and from people who want their hand held throughout a children's game.

"As a huge fan of Fromsoftware who has played every single release since PS3 demon souls i can no longer call myself a fan of this developer. They have dropped the ball on the PC port more than CD Project red has with Cyberpunk when it comes to performance and optimization. Horrendous stuttering, FPS ranges between 20-40 on a machine that should be able to keep a steady 60 at least, awful glitches with enemies, npcs, and Torrent the mount flickering in and out of existence, and texture popping in and out as they load. Meanwhile the games journalists call this trainwreck of a PC port a master piece. Not to mention the last minute DRM/anti-cheat that was added due to the hackers in DAS3 a month before release. I have nothing to comment on gameplay itself since i dropped it due to it being completely unbearable, imagine having healthbars attacking you out of nowhere while you riding an invisible mount at 20 fps, how is that enjoyable? Shame on Fromsoftware for screwing over its fanbase and releasing a game at its current state.",0.0

"Do not buy if you play keyboard and mouse. All the input prompts are designed for an xbox controller style input. Finding the keyboard key that is mapped to the action for the button it's indicating will not work, leaving it impossible to complete some actions. In addition invisible enemies, stuttering, and input lag on the keyboard and mouse (may be a result of stuttering? idk) make this EXTREMELY frustrating to play. I'm playing on a 5950x w/ 64 gigs of ram and a 3080. I shouldn't have any stuttering so it's obviously some issue. Maybe it'll be patched complete one day. It's not as disappointing as cyberpunk was on launch, as long as you want to play with a gamepad. if you really want to play this game get it on console or wait for a sale/massive patching.",0.0

"I find it hilarious tht I am forced to give a 10/10 to a game tht I havent even finished because of the reviewbombing of ppl tht did not also finish the game, tht dont even own the game and are salty because a game genre they dont like is being successful, and performance issues malders. Performance isnt good but its not unplayable to the point of giving a game 0. Funny how for one time in your life you should actually listen to some game journos and not the community which is appalling. This is like the situation where italians would reviewbomb games a 0 because they didnt have italian dubs. My thoughts having 12hours in and defeating the first two main bosses are tht the story seems pretty interesting like any other souls game, the combat when the game runs smoothly is really great especially with the new weapon arts, open world is somewhat empty... and thts someone who hasnt played the game would tell you. I dont want to spoil the open world but there is a lot to uncover in it trust me. Bosses are AMAZING. World design is great graphics arent tht good just a bit of a step up from ds3 and the performance isnt good. When you load into areas the frame does drop in pretty much every pc which is smthing tht needs a fix. If you like any souls game you should absolutely get this one. Let the haters, which unfortunately exist for this game, cope harder and just enjoy yourself its a really good game so far.",1.0

None of these reviews from users are legit. It’s obvious they haven’t played the game or they’re running it on a turd.

To call it the greatest of all time you need more than just a good game play, it's missing the graphics, story, music and optimization. Story wise it didn't have any deeply crafted story like the Witcher or dramatic story that bind you and the character like Read Dead Redemption 2 did with Arthur.

Battles are clunky hack and slash affairs with little enjoyment to be had.  I will say that my dual sense PS5 controller worked decently well with the game.  I didn't give this game a super low rating because it isn't terrible, it just isn't good.

Why do the devs force PC users, who're perfectly happy with mouse and keyboard (far higher skill ceiling &amp; superior fidelity), to use a controller? From Software just don't get it, it’s 2022, every other new AAA release has pretty much the same PC controls and user interface, which have been standardized over decades. Why does Elden Ring look like something from the 2000’s? The devs are lazy, and/or incompetent, couldn't care less about the PC market. Lots of Souls fanbois and paid “reviewers” making weak excuses for this garbage. I dare these shills to make a direct comparison between Elden Ring and God Of War or HZN, there’s just no comparison, it’s absolute garbage, Elden Ring falls well short of basic expectations.",0.2

The game is nowhere near graphically intensive enough to run this poorly on high end hardware, and the stuttering is insufferable. I have a 3080, 58800x, and 32gb RAM, yet this clunker often struggles to hit 60 fps. Cyberpunk 2077 ran smoother, had much higher end graphics, and also had an open world. That, paired with the 60fps cap and the ham fisted lack of Ultrawide support kind of ruins this.
