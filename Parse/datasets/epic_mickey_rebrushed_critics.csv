"Disney Epic Mickey Rebrushed is a necessary and competent remake that respects the original, making what was already good even better. Its mature story speaks well to older players and opens up a new world for younger players by taking us on a journey through Disney's past. A game with a great replay factor, simple and intuitive gameplay, and a length that is just right, showing that the genre still has a lot to offer, bringing a touch of novelty amidst so many games that are more of the same.",1.0,3
"The definitive version of a colourful adventure that will charm you from start to finish, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is an edgy Mickey Mouse tale to be remembered. This version is much more than just a new coat of paint!",0.91,3
"Epic Mickey is a stunning-looking game packed with memorable locations, a cast of unforgettable characters, and solid meat-and-potatoes gameplay. The paintbrush mechanic is satisfying and feels right at home in the Wasteland without every coming across as too gimmicky. There's a few annoying hiccups here and there, but overall, Epic Mickey is an adventure worth your time.",0.9,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed brings back the beloved Wii classic, and does it spectacularly. In addition to having the basics, such as improved graphics, the remake adds new features to the original adventure, such as improved control and new moves for the main character. It is sure to become a real gem for fans of the animation studio.",0.9,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a delight to play. Purple Lamp did a fantastic job of remaking the game from scratch with grand visuals and the addition of a double jump makes the game more playable than its Wii incarnation. The paint and thinner mechanics are a true highlight of this Disney adventure, and the overall atmosphere of the game is both creepy and upbeat. It would be a real treat to see if Purple Lamp could make an Epic Mickey 3 in the future, as this game shows the Vienna-studio's talent of making the Wasteland come to life.",0.9,3
"Disney Epic MIckey: Rebrushed is a joy to revisit or play for the first time in 2024. The few design flaws that do present aren't nearly impactful enough to bring down the whole experience. Epic Mickey remains one of Disney's strongest showing in the medium of games, and Rebrushed is a nostalgic and heartwarming reminder why. ",0.85,3
"A remaster of Epic Mickey didn’t need much to be a slam dunk, other than to save this inventive and introspective piece of Disney history from finding itself in the same state as the ‘toons it spotlights – unworthy of the current corporate image and left to decay in the dark. As a bonus though, Purple Lamp’s capable brushstrokes have managed to both preserve the art and make it easier than ever to appreciate.",0.85,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed corrects all the flaws of the original to provide a much more polished and enjoyable experience with the most famous mouse of all. Despite its simple appearance, it has much to offer, making it a highly recommended title, especially if you enjoy platforming games.",0.85,3
"Epic Mickey is a remake that fixes the problems of the original games. If you like platformer games or Disney characters, you'll definitely enjoy it. If you like both, this will be a great treatment.",0.8,3
Developer Purple Lamp successfully brings the Wii original into the year 2024 with mostly fully new graphics that (more or less) make the remake look like a current production. The action adventure is too undemanding for a must-have. But with its creative gameplay and as an atmospheric Homage to Disney classics it's worth buying not simply for fans of the original.,0.8,3
"Originally a Wii exclusive, Epic Mickey Rebrushed has had an incredible face lift, making it feel every bit as fresh as a brand new game from 2024. This is a rich and worthwhile adventure-platformer even if you're not a huge Disney fan — but if you are, you'll get a huge kick out of the frequent nods to the company's long history.",0.8,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a wonderful remake that looks gorgeous in many different ways, with simple yet fun platforming at its core.",0.8,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed brings some important touches to a unique platformer that can now be played again under better conditions. It could have been better, but the remastering work is competent and reminds us of the great virtues that this Wii exclusive had.",0.8,3
"A lovely time capsule of a game, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is exactly the kind of nostalgia we need. A fresh lick of paint brings Mickey's adventure up to today's standard, with a simple approach to gameplay to draw in the young and old alike.",0.8,3
"There are some lovely 2D side-scrolling moments too, which helps to break up the gameplay. You can even replay your faves in a new option.",0.8,3
"Disney Epic Mickey Rebrushed is a pleasant surprise and just as much a love letter to Warren’s Spector game as that creation was to the Disney Universe itself. The ability to change the surrounding world and see the consequences of your actions still feels fresh and engaging. The new addition might not be groundbreaking, but they help leave behind the shackles of the Wii and turn the game into an experience without frustrations caused by certain limitations. And even better news is that in the future we might see a remake of the sequel, making the story whole.",0.8,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a heartfelt love letter to the early days of Disney and the delightfully weird shorts that built the house of Mouse brick by brick. More than that it’s the kind of lovingly crafted platformer, with a unique hook, a gorgeous world to explore, and new adventures around every corner. There’s a word to describe it, its just on the tip of my tongue – monumentous?",0.8,3
Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed remains a strange game but one that's compelling and rewarding. It's excellent that this Wii classic is this enjoyable all of these years after its initial release and it looks great this time around to boot.,0.79,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a renovation of the original game rather than just a fresh coat of paint. Of course, it's a remake that stays loyal to the plot, combat, and level design while making improvements to the graphics, controls, and camera—aspects of the game that were criticized on the 2010 version. It also has some intriguing changes that this cult game never had before.",0.78,3
"Disney Epic Mickey is back, this time as a multiplatform title. The game formula is still enjoyable thanks to the magic brush mechanic and the graphic facelift operated by Purple Lamp is appreciable, as are the improved camera system. Unfortunately, the longevity remains quite poor, also due to secondary activities that are not particularly stimulating.",0.78,3
Quotation forthcoming.,0.75,3
"Disney’s Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a wonderful remake that remains faithful to the original whilst adding new elements to improve the adventure. Mickey is now much more mobile and the revised controls remove frustrations that engulfed the Wii release. Though the game lacks challenge and includes rather basic combat, its stunning visual overhaul and new features give it a new lease of life, making it a worthwhile revisit for both newcomers and longtime fans.",0.75,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a fresh coat of paint for the twisted take on Disney’s forgotten edges, yet it falls short of being a masterpiece. As remakes go, the game breathes new life into the graphics, even adding extra gameplay moves and other quality-of-life improvements. However, a tedious objective system and a lack of voiced dialogue feels like a missed opportunity for Mickey’s return. Despite this, the title shines in its preservation of a unique chapter in Disney’s gaming legacy and offers hope that we might just see more from Mickey and Oswald yet.",0.75,3
"Disney’s Epic Mickey Rebrushed is full of new ideas and innovations and offers an interesting story in a dark fantasy world that is nothing like our perception of Disney’s world. The use of a paintbrush and other mechanics related to it in gameplay make Epic Mickey a very unique platformer experience, but issues such as inconsistent controls, bad camera, and repetitive missions eventually prevent it from becoming one of the best in the genre.",0.75,3
"Epic Mickey is still an enjoyable platformer with impeccable artistic talent driving it. The repetitive combat and exploration remains, but the Rebrushed updates go some way to remedying those shortcomings.",0.7,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed remains a fun platformer, but it falls short compared to modern titles like Astro Bot or The Plucky Squire. While the game's originality shines through and fans of the original will enjoy it, its slow pacing, dated presentation, and occasionally frustrating controls hold it back. Despite these flaws, it offers plenty of nostalgic charm for longtime players.",0.7,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a welcome return to the world of the Wasteland. While not the most challenging game, it has that Disney charm from start to finish.",0.7,3
"I’m not sure that anything can ever capture the lightning in a bottle that was Epic Mickey’s original concept, but Rebrushed is the closest thing we’ll ever get to that dark magic, even if one of its core pillars is something that still drags it down. If you’re a diehard fan, you’ll love all of the small changes Rebrushed makes to cut down on the grind and monotony the original suffered from, and if you’re a newcomer you’ll experience Disney’s weirdest venture at its absolute best.",0.7,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is exactly what you’d want from a remastered Wii game. It gives the visuals the contemporary sheen worthy of its unique art style, adds important control improvements to make it palatable to modern audiences, and also knows when to let the gameplay speak for itself. ",0.7,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a frustratingly faithful remake of a game that was already pretty decent. It looks great, and the quality of life additions make it much more enjoyable, but if you didn’t click with the original, there’s not much here that will change your mind.",0.7,3
Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a great idea held back by the era of games in which it was created. Younger players and fanatics of classic Disney may have a blast seeing this creative spin on the source material. But there’s little else that it does to stand out among the genre’s best.,0.7,3
"If you fancy a slightly old-school 3D platformer, Disney Epic Mickey is not a bad choice. Especially if you associate Disney with happy childhood memories, because the game, like the forgotten Disney characters in Wasteland, deserves a new turn in the spotlight and Purple Lamp and THQ Nordic make sure it gets it with this excellent remaster.",0.7,3
"You can tell that there was care and love put into this, and I’m rather thankful that something like this exists at all. Epic Mickey: Rebrushed does enough to justify being a worthy remake of a somewhat beloved game, though it’s not everyone’s cup of tea. It’s a solid platformer in its own right, and the new additions are welcome ones.",0.7,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed successfully improves upon the flawed original in some key ways, thus allowing its strengths to shine much brighter, but significant lingering issues in other areas hold it back from greatness.",0.7,3
"The changes have certainly made Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed a more fluid experience. It doesn't bring a lot of challenge but the new visuals have given plenty of life to the environments, even if they're mostly grim and dark. The control changes feel natural. The backtracking in the middle can slightly dampen the pace but, on the whole, I found the experience to be straight-forward. The presentation shines as a wander through some of Disney's vintage heyday but behind the nostalgia is a competent platformer.",0.7,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a worthwhile play if you are a fan of Disney, particularly the Disney Parks, as there are plenty of visual nods that are a joy to see. After all, which of us wouldn’t want to platform up Space Mountain, or restore a dilapidated It’s a Small World? But for the casual platforming fan, you won’t find much here that you’ve likely not experienced before. Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is an improvement upon its predecessor, adding depth and nicely updating the controls, and with that, returning fans will find what is, overall, a satisfying experience. The problem is, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is also stuck in the past with its lack of innovation and in today’s market, it’s hard to overlook that.",0.6,3
"If you gave someone who absolutely despises 3D platformers to make one, you’d probably get something like Epic Mickey Rebrushed. Even though this Remaster looks nicer than the original, it only managed to remind us how disappointing the original game was. As much as we love Mickey Mouse and 3D platformers, maybe it’s time to use the paint thinner on this one.",0.6,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a sandbox collect-a-thon that pays homage to the earliest eras of Disney creations. This no risk/no reward game looks good from the opening, but just seems like an animated feature that went on for 12 hours too long. With too much chatter, not enough fun, and literal pocket thinner, Epic is not the word I would paint here. ",0.55,3
"Disney Epic Mickey Rebrushed is set to be a definitive edition for fans and newcomers alike. With its stunning visuals, improved controls, and the timeless charm of the original, Rebrushed is a delightful adventure for Disney and platforming enthusiasts. The playtime of Rebrushed remains similar to the original, offering roughly 15 hours for the main story and an additional 10 hours for completionists seeking every collectible. If you didn't get the chance to play the original, then Rebrushed is well worth your time. And even if you did play the Wii version, then Disney Epic Mickey Rebrushed is the perfect opportunity to head back into the Wasteland and get your artistic side flowing.",0.86,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is an impressive remake of an already marvelous game. It features the story depth that is unusual for Disney, going beyond the confines of cartoonish fairy tales, while also paying the tribute to the company's classics. This is a mix that certainly deserves your attention.",0.85,3
"Armed with a magical paintbrush that can paint or thin out obstacles to uncover the path forward, Purple Lamb has given players a colorful and delightful remake that is faithful to its original release. Truly delivering Mickey’s best and most epic adventure finally for last and next-gen consoles and PC.",0.85,3
"Honestly, it’s kind of a relief that Epic Mickey: Rebrushed turned out so well. It’s not uncommon to have fond memories of an older game that turned out to wildly inaccurate in terms of remembering how good that older game actually was, so playing a remake like this, that shows Epic Mickey was just as fun as I remember it (even if it has an obvious new coat of paint), brings some a welcome feeling. Will Epic Mickey: Rebrushed garner the same kind of cult following that the Wii game got? Probably not – but hopefully that’s because being on more platforms allows more people to play this delightful game.",0.85,3
Quotation forthcoming.,0.81,3
"We welcome the return of the most famous mouse in the world with joy, albeit with a hint of bitterness: the game created by the now defunct Junction Point oozes originality from every brush stroke, and who knows, maybe one day Warren Spector and his colleagues will be able to give us a third chapter. The certainty remains that we are faced with one of the highest creative peaks reached in those years, and what better occasion than a graphic remake to rediscover its beauty?",0.8,3
"If you’re going to play Epic Mickey in 2024 – and you should – this is the definitive way to play the games. Clever tweaks here and there have significantly enhanced the original game, improving it across multiple aspects, without sacrificing the originality and uniqueness of its narrative. This is a chance to re-appreciate one of the best Wii exclusive games in a whole new format.",0.8,3
"I spent much more time with this remake than I would have thought beforehand! ... Like the original, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a damn likeable declaration of love to the Disney universe centered around the famous mouse.",0.8,3
"Mickey Rebrushed manages to revive a classic that, despite its flaws, still holds a special place in the hearts of many gamers. The remaster offers visual and gameplay improvements that make the Wasteland worth revisiting.",0.76,3
"Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a solid remaster that enhances the original experience with some nice improvements. Unfortunately, the experience is still carried by the setting exploring Disney's forgotten history, as the remaster does little to address dated level design, lackluster combat, and underdeveloped features like the morality system. Despite these shortcomings, Mickey's journey in the Wasteland remains enjoyable, especially for hardcore Disney fans eager to see some of the company’s long-forgotten characters brought back to life.",0.75,3
"Disney’s Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a solid revitalization of a work with grand ambitions, perhaps weighed down by the high expectations surrounding its creator. While it remains a good game, straddling the line between platformer and action-adventure, the overall quality feels somewhat inconsistent. The remaster smooths out some of the game’s more notorious rough edges and improves certain aspects of gameplay, but it can’t fully overturn the fate of a title that needed to do much more to leave a lasting impression.",0.75,3
"While a gorgeous remake with great quality of life features, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed still suffers by being itself. Outside of the aesthetic and choices, Epic Mickey was a fairly rote platformer with uninteresting challenges and objectives. Rebrushed adds a wonderful new coat of paint, but it’s still the same game at its core. ",0.75,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed updates a 2010 Wii classic for a new generation, somehow packing in even more nostalgia and twisted Disney references than ever before. An engaging story, gorgeous visuals, and bags of charm make it well worth the wait, despite some technical hitches and gameplay frustrations that detract from its undeniable potential.",0.7,3
"If you like Mickey Mouse and want to play a fun video game about him, you can do a lot worse than Epic Mickey: Rebrushed! You can also do a lot better, but that would require booting up some old emulators or expensive retro hardware, which is a different kind of thing from having something new(ish) on today’s platforms. Those decaying SNES carts in Mickeyjunk Mountain offer a good hint at what you should try next, though. I enjoyed it quite a bit, even if the way the story doesn't hold up in 2024 due to historical context made things kind of awkward.",0.7,3
"Epic Mickey Rebrushed is the ultimate version of the game and the team at Purple Lamp have clearly put a lot of love into updating the game for a contemporary audience. That being said, the additions to Mickey’s moveset are completely unnecessary and the core game remains largely the same. If you’ve played Epic Mickey before then this version will bring back any nostalgia you have for the game and if you haven’t then it is a good way to experience a neglected title. The lack of anything more than a cosmetic upgrade does make the high price a little hard to justify but this is still a solid game for anyone with a fondness for the Mouse. ",0.7,3
"Ultimately, Epic Mickey Rebrushed is a warm welcome, even if several aspects leave you wanting more improvements. This game deserves to be played by more people and beyond the confines of a multi-generation-old game system with an awful control scheme. Particularly with this game’s historical significance to a massive company like Disney, Epic Mickey Rebrushed does Mickey Mouse justice in a light that we rarely see the famous mouse. But, instead of being a modern classic, it just feels like a fun piece of Disney history.",0.7,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be a fun time for any 3D platformer and Disney fan, with all sorts of references to the past. It is a fascinating game that brings people deeper into the characters and worlds that Walt Disney created in his early days, and will be worth exploring Wasteland again for those that played the original Wii version thanks to the improvements made mechanically and visually. This is still a rather basic platformer that treads the line of tedium due to outdated fetch quests, and voice acting could have really benefitted the story scenes, but there is a great charm to this game, despite the darker tone, that will appeal to many.",0.7,3
A real clean sweep in a remaster that will only appeal to absolute fans or those who haven't played the original title.,0.7,3
"It retains the original charm, with graphical improvements and new mechanics, but could have made more use of the visual potential and challenged players more.",0.6,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed brings back the iconic 2010 Wii platformer with a fresh coat of paint. Though the nostalgia is undeniable, the gameplay mechanics and morality system feel outdated, leaving much to be desired. Its charming premise and art style may appeal to diehard fans, but performance issues on PC further dampen the experience.",0.55,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a throwback to a game that was a throwback when it came out, and it shows. While updated graphics put a nice coat of paint on things, and the story is far more intriguing than you’d expect from this sort of title, they don’t mask that underneath it, all the core mechanics and level design here don’t hold up. Fans of Mickey Mouse might put up with them to see one of the more interesting versions of the character in recent decades; everyone else should brush up on a better platformer.",0.5,3
"As someone who doesn't really get on with the source material, I find myself warmed by Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed. It's not all that challenging and sometimes a bit eh, but I liked that easygoing nature more than I resented it. You're free to splosh paint around and stumble into cool mechanical puzzles or simply remove the floor from an enemy and watch them plunge to their death. And while some of the side quests and optional tidbits don't amount to much more than, at most, an end credit sequence, I admire its adventurous spirit. You can tell it tries to do things a bit differently to the usual platformer and for the most part, it works.",-0.01,3
"Though I’ve always enjoyed Epic Mickey, I’m thrilled to have revisited the game, as it has held up remarkably well. This remake makes it better than ever. If you’re looking for that “Disney Magic,” so to speak, you’d be hard-pressed to find much better than this. Full of surprises, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a delight. ",0.9,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a welcome return for one of Mickey’s most memorable adventures, this is just about everything one could’ve wanted out of a revisit to a lost classic. It fumbles its execution a bit with the performance, but there are enough novel ideas and enjoyable gameplay concepts here to make the experience more than worth your while. Enjoyable gameplay, a captivating world, lots of replayability, and a raft of tweaks and improvements over the original make this one an easy sell. We’d recommend this to anyone looking for a big-budget 3D platformer that does things a little differently from the genre norms, and of course to anyone who considers themselves an avid Disney fan.",0.8,3
"Epic Mickey Rebrushed is a wonderful reminder of why the original is one of the best Disney games of all time, taking you on a charming journey full of fun levels, great characters, an enjoyable story, and a much-improved camera.",0.8,3
"I’m delighted to see Epic Mickey getting a second shot at life, and escaping exclusivity after all these years. This isn’t some landmark 3D platformer, but it’s a game with an incredible amount of heart put into it. While I would have loved to see this remaster do a bit more to smooth over the rough edges in game design, its respectful approach to updating the visuals is excellently done. Performance unfortunately isn’t perfect on the Switch, though it isn’t game breaking either. This is and always has been a game that will appeal to a very specific combo of 3D platforming and Disney fans, but for that audience it remains a flawed but charming trip into the forgotten past.",0.75,3
"The insufferable camera has been corrected, fast travel has been added, there are more collectibles to obtain, and new movement skills that make it not feel slow. For its part, the graphics have undergone a touch-up that will please both insiders and outsiders, although it was not optimized in the best way on all platforms.",0.7,3
