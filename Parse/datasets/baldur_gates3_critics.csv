"Baldur's Gate 3 is a genuine all-timer, this really is as good as RPGs get, and it's an all-timer that's arrived on Series X in fine form aside from a pesky issue with deleted saves. Returning to Baldur's Gate and successfully serving up the best entry in the series to date must have been an absolutely monumental task, but Larian Studios has managed it with style to spare.

Flawlessly succeeding in what most choice-based narrative games seem to fall short of perfecting, the freedom of choice is endless. The D&amp;D based gameplay sticks close to its roots, with a blend of genres and lore as well as the implementation of the ever-present dice roll and turn-based combat.

Online Multiplayer is a breeze to set up and works so well considering how much goes into Baldur’s Gate III as a whole.

"Simply put, Baldur’s Gate 3 is a masterpiece. Larian Studios has done such a phenomenal job at bringing back an IP that has laid dormant since 2000 (2013 if you count the Baldur’s Gate 2 remaster – I, do not) and inadvertently put out a game that spits in the face of contemporary, predatory game design. While I don’t think it will be the new standard of RPGs, I think it stands as an example for aspiring RPG developers that, when given the appropriate amount of time, an RPG does not have to conform to the lifeless norms that the AAA industry has fed us for so many years. Larian, you have truly outdone yourselves, and your work will more than likely stand as one of the greatest achievements in gaming.",1.0,1,ENGLISH

"The scope of Baldur’s Gate 3 is scandalously large and, what’s more, Larian Studios manages to make good on every detail. It’s up there with the greats, an adventure that any avid role-player will revel in, and one that few will ever regret embarking on.",1.0,1,ENGLISH
"Baldur's Gate 3 manages to pull off the spontaneity and unpredictable nature of a long-stretching Dungeons and Dragons tabletop game. The story is intriguing with beautifully woven side quests but never feels like it's forcing you in a set moral direction. You can be as lawful good, or chaotically evil as you wish from scene to scene, and the game will be a different experience for each and every player. Character voice acting, motion capture, and a spellbinding soundtrack make the game world feel alive and the storytelling compelling. The only limit to your experience is your imagination and creativity, and while the sheer volume of possible outcomes can lead to bugs and occasional immersion-breaking moments, Larian has ultimately achieved its ambition for a generation-defining RPG.",1.0,1,ENGLISH
"BG3 is a highwater mark for choice-driven RPGs and the new standard to which basically every other major RPG will be compared. I feel bad for Starfield at this point and for game developers in general. Larian Studios has set the bar incredibly high. Still, I hope other publishers will see it as an example to let developers have time and creative freedom to make incredible games without all the bloated live service and microtransaction bullshit. Also, you can play this game in four-player online co-op or even split-screen locally on a single PC, and in this day and age, that may be one of the most impressive features in BG3. If you love RPGs, you owe it to yourself to play this game. ",1.0,1,ENGLISH
"In case you couldn’t tell, I f.cking love this game....Baldur’s Gate 3 is truly exemplary, one of the few videogames in history that wholly deserve the universal acclaim heaped so freely upon releases above a certain marketing budget. The choices offered to the player in terms of both crafting an adventurer and influencing the story do an incredible job of translating Dungeons &amp; Dragons to a form of interactive software that surpasses the loftiest expectation. The script is incredible, the gameplay beneath it downright luxurious. There won't be another like this in a long, long time. ",1.0,1,ENGLISH
"Near the end of Baldur's Gate 3, a character says, ""Too much freedom can be frightening."" It's a powerful line within the context of the story, but it also speaks to Baldur's Gate 3 on a deeper level. The freedom that it offers is unprecedented, and it takes a little while to really see the scope of what that means for the game. At times, the sheer number of choices and consequences can be overwhelming. But before long, it becomes apparent that Baldur's Gate 3 allows players to be the authors of their own destinies in a way no other game has before. It's that freedom and reactivity paired with its excellent presentation and fantastic characters that really set Baldur's Gate 3 apart, and it's why after 200 hours I'm still coming back to it. Too much freedom can be frightening, but Larian trusts its players to make the most of it, for better or for worse.",1.0,1,ENGLISH

Hopefully, it is able to reap the richly deserved rewards for doing so.",1.0,1,ENGLISH
"Larian Studios, the creators of the latest installment, have gone to great lengths to make sure they didn't disgrace any of the franchise's building blocks. The love and care is evident in Baldur's Gate 3, though needless to pretend, there aren't a few bricks crumbling here and there in this monument. It's far from a perfect title, but on the whole Baldur's Gate 3 is a brilliant computer RPG that is undoubtedly not to be overlooked. [Issue#329]",1.0,1,ENGLISH
"Baldur's Gate 3 is incredible, proof that in 2023 it is still possible to be amazed by a video game. It is deep, flexible, and engaging, but most importantly, it is able to tell an immersive story dictated by the player's smallest choices. Pioneers like Richard Garriott or Robert Woodhead can finally breathe a sigh of relief and enjoy a well-deserved retirement, because their legacy is safe in the hands of Larian Studios.",0.99,1,ENGLISH
"If you’re an RPG fan, get Baldur’s Gate 3. Now. It’s one of those titles that feels like a ‘once in a century’ experience. Its systems are deep while being rewarding and thrilling to master. Its narrative is bold, exciting, and at times, devastatingly heartbreaking. Though – to BG3’s credit – the writing never gets to the point of being overly complicated and full of itself. Even if you don’t consider yourself an RPG fan, you must play it. Baldur’s Gate 3 is that good. It’s a rare achievement that will sit in the discussion of the greatest games ever made for the rest of time. Bravo to Larian Studios for crafting a genuine work of art.",0.99,1,ENGLISH

"Baldur's Gate III is an amazing game. While the length can be intimidating and the lore vast - that makes it all the more compelling and the game could easily become one of the biggest time sinks for gamers since the likes of Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim or Elden Ring released. If you're a fan of Larian Studios' previous work, DND, strategy RPGs, or any of the above, BG3 is almost certainly the game for you, and comes highly recommended.",0.97,1,ENGLISH
"Baldur's Gate 3 is an outstanding role-playing game, both in terms of its gameplay and its technical aspects (still with areas to be polished via patch), one that, moreover, is destined to become one of the benchmarks of the genre for taking some ideas, such as the election system and its reactive world, to a level that others have not even dreamed of. ",0.96,1,ENGLISH
"It's difficult to imagine just how much effort and passion Larian Studios put into Baldur's Gate 3 to create such a groundbreaking masterpiece. As the first sequel in two decades, it successfully continues the legendary story of Baldur's Gate. With exceptional freedom and intricate combat mechanics, it opens up the possibility for more people to enjoy the unique appeal of DND. It overshadows all the games I've played this year and gives us a CRPG experience like no other.",0.96,1,ENGLISH

"Baldur's Gate III is not entirely without flaws, and they tend to become more noticeable in the game's last act (especially when it comes down to optimization), but none of that change the fact that we are dealing with a CRPG masterpiece and Larian's crowning achievement after an already long and quite successful career. Weather you are a returning fan or a new one, there is almost no reason to not give this one a go, if you are passionate about computer role-playing games.",0.96,1,ENGLISH
"With its engaging story, charming characters, extremely dynamic world that constantly reacts and adapts to the player's actions and choice and a solid tactical combat system, Baldur's Gate 3 is among the best cRPGs ever released. A wonky interface, the lack of some quality-of-life features and Larian Studios' trademark save scumming design impact the experience, but they're only minor issues that don't away too much from the whole experience. After years in development, Baldur's Gate 3 definitely exceeded all expectations, and in the best possible way.",0.95,1,ENGLISH
"I can’t help but compare it to a great session of Dungeons and Dragons with your friends, it's something that when done correctly will stay with you long after you have finished a play session.

It’s an outstanding achievement that will stand the test of time even as we move into the next generation of gaming.

Still, the narrative, graphic design, voice performances, and tactical gameplay do a lot to bring the experience back up to amazing.",0.95,1,ENGLISH
"A mind blowing game, that consecrates Larian Studios as one of the greats of the RPG genre, and will probably have the same impact today that its predecessors had in their age. It's a superb and brilliant game, that we wholly recommend to anyone who loves the genre, or deep video games in general.",0.95,1,ENGLISH
"Baldur's Gate 3 is the best RPG in years. The game is not made for everyone and has a steep learning curve, especially for non-D&amp;D players. But those willing to dive in will find a game that offers you more freedom of choice than we've ever seen in peers.",0.95,1,ENGLISH
"Baldur's Gate 3 deserves the title of Game of the Year, plain and simple. Having sunk around 100 hours into the game since its launch, and with the city of Baldur's Gate still a distant sight, it's a challenge to tear myself away from the captivating narrative I've woven. Both my impressions from the early access phase and my time with the full release have remained consistent: the game is a masterpiece.",0.95,1,ENGLISH
"Larian has built one of the most intricate virtual worlds I’ve ever seen and, despite a few hiccups, Baldur’s Gate 3 remains the finest example of its genre available today.",0.95,1,ENGLISH
"What to say, what to do... if not to bow humbly in front of so much talent. Larian Studios once again proves its expertise in the field of role-playing games and even manages to sublimate the rich and complex universe of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Baldurs' Gate 3 is quite simply the best D&amp;D video game adaptation ever made. This adventure “of which you are the hero” shines with its generosity, its mastery of the codes of the genre and this constant desire to surpass oneself. BG3 can boast of being the ultimate video game experience for role-players, but not only. Admittedly, this RPG requires a good PC to play in optimal conditions and proves to be a bit tough to learn, especially for the uninitiated. But to play Baldur's Gate III is to create your own story, a story that belongs only to you. Just for that (and more), the pleasure is total!",0.95,1,ENGLISH
"Baldur’s Gate 3 is unforgettable and one of the best experiences I’ve had in games. I may have just finished my lengthy first playthrough, but I’m already eager to delve further and push the boundaries of what’s possible in this exceptional world that Larian created.",0.95,1,ENGLISH
"Ultimately Baldur's Gate 3 is, in no uncertain terms, a shining jewel of design and programming, so deep, layered and sumptuous that it can be considered the new golden standard of the genre: a benchmark of prodigious magnitude that will be a real nightmare for anyone want to embark, in the future, on the development of titles belonging to the same category. Where many would have crashed to the ground by replicating the myth of Icarus and the Sun, Larian Studios triumphs and brings a sequel to PC that in many ways even surpasses its illustrious predecessors. In short, the throne of the best RPG of the generation has just been claimed.",0.95,1,ENGLISH
"Faerûn is a unique world. The story of Baldur's Gate 3 is outstanding. Coupled with gameplay that knows how to effectively mix the turn-based system with its exploration in real time. A ten music that manages to transport us to a fantasy environment that has a looming danger. The building of relationships, the enemies and the dangers that we will find in Faerûn, make this Larian adventure almost 100% complete. A game that will go down in history and remain in the hearts of millions of players forever. Highly recommended.",0.95,1,ENGLISH
"I could easily keep talking about this game, from the romance scenes that honestly had a lot of heart put into them or about various small encounters that I had just roaming around the map. Baldur’s Gate 3 may not be a one-to-one recreation of a system that many of us know, but that doesn’t hold it back in any form. Instead, the spirit of Dungeons &amp; Dragons is inside the very fiber of Baldur’s Gate 3; it can sometimes be silly and outlandish. However, there is a lot to love here, and there aren’t many words that could really convey how much I love this game and glad that while the battle system may not be what I expected, once I adjusted myself to it, it gave me almost everything else I could want out of a game.",0.95,1,ENGLISH
Baldur's Gate 3 is an exceptionally well-written game with breathtaking visuals and charming NPCs. The game's combat is creative and allows all sorts of maneuvers that you can think of. Larian Studios's CRPG shows that the genre can be accessible and brings the best out of Dungeons &amp; Dragons: a universe of peculiar beings that unite under a greater good.,0.95,1,ENGLISH
"We praised Larian a lot for  Divinity: Original Sin 2, but Baldur's Gate 3 is without a doubt their masterpiece. It's an experience that deserves its name in every sense and trilogizes the Baldur's Gate saga in a spectacular way. If it makes up for its shortcomings with an Enhanced Edition, we can easily call it one of the best games of the 2000s.",0.95,1,ENGLISH
"Fans of cRPG couldn't have hoped for a better sequel of one of the most revered franchises in the history of this genre. Larian Studios should be proud for setting new standards, creating a  highly ambitious reactive world filled to the brim with quality content, accompanied by a deep combat system and excellent writing.",0.95,1,ENGLISH
"There are good games and great games, and then there are games that change the game entirely. Baldur’s Gate III is that rare case that charts its own route, building on the best of what came before it and breaking new ground. With how responsive the game is to the specifics of your created character, it could be explored virtually forever with endless new stuff to discover tucked into millions of little corners. The world is intricate and wonderous enough to want to live in it, and the characters are so intriguing that you cherish every conversation and want to save them all from themselves (and good luck doing that!). It’s an explosion of the imagination so powerful that it’s unthinkable that Larian was able to fit it all into one game, but they did. So, gather your party and venture forth!",0.95,1,ENGLISH

"An incredible achievement in role-playing game design, in terms of the level of freedom and interactivity – although even ignoring the bugs it’s not quite as consistent as you might hope.",0.9,1,ENGLISH
"It has heart, it has style, and it has the multi-year effort of a studio that obviously loves its source material. The mind-blowing size of the game itself and everything contained within is a testament to Larian Studios' dedication to its craft and commitment to bringing something incredible to the gaming public.",0.9,1,ENGLISH
"Baldur's Gate III is everything an RPG adventure should be. It's appropriately epic while also spending time with the small moments. It allows you to feel powerful while also rewarding you for being clever and avoiding trouble. It offers the class fantasy of everything from a stalwart paladin to a hellish abomination, from fast-talking trickster to rage-filled barbarian. It has its quirks and flaws, but they usually add welcome texture to the game. Perhaps most importantly of all, it captures the feeling of sitting down and playing through a D&amp;D adventure with some friends.",0.9,1,ENGLISH
"Far from being a simple sequel to a cult license, Baldur's Gate 3 is a new monument to role-playing. It never ceases to impress, both in terms of its high-quality production and its incredible richness on every level. But perhaps the most astonishing thing is the sheer range of possibilities on offer, almost unheard of for a game of this scale and complexity. It's a great adventure in which you can progress in your own way, without feeling restricted. The game has almost everything it takes to become a new absolute reference in the genre, and apart from a few finishing and interface problems, the criticism that can be levelled at it is that it may prove too much of a chunk for many players. You need to have hundreds of hours ahead of you to really appreciate it fully.",0.9,1,ENGLISH
"If you’re a fan of deep storytelling, strategic combat, and a world that responds to your every action, Baldur’s Gate 3 is an adventure you won’t want to miss. The path ahead is treacherous and filled with uncertainty, but isn’t that what makes a journey truly unforgettable?",0.9,1,ENGLISH
"Baldur’s Gate 3 may not be the most welcoming game to those not well-versed in the CRPG genre, but once you get past any initial hurdles, you’ll find one of the most profound and engrossing releases the genre has seen in the last decade. It allows so much freedom and so many options that it can be rather overwhelming, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. This is the sort of game I know I’ll be replaying to see more paths and more options for years to come.",0.9,1,ENGLISH
"The RPG legend returned and took everyone's breath away. You will forgive its minor flaws because it offers an epic experience in a well-known fantasy universe. Although the basic principles of the game are mostly well known, the way in which the characters and the story are formed, with remarkable options that can change it dramatically, all this makes this game unique.",0.9,1,ENGLISH
"Baldur's Gate 3 is a beacon of all the untapped potential in the CRPG genre. While it may be a bit much for newcomers, it's a gripping experience that no one with even an inkling of interest in the genre should miss.",0.9,1,ENGLISH
"Baldur's Gate 3 is an outstanding and complete RPG. All of its elements work brilliantly and mesh together to create something unique. Calling this game a continuation of the series may be a bit controversial, but it doesn't change the fact that this game is as close to a masterpiece as it gets. Many things are executed much better than in the first two installments, and we finally feel that we have a real impact on the world and events. It's like taking part in the best session of a tabletop RPG.",0.9,1,ENGLISH

"The first 60-70 hours were near-faultless, with Larian Studios providing an experience unmatched in the role-playing space. I could continue to nitpick over how I wished that ambition and quality could sustain right until the end credits, but then I think about the whole journey I went through with my Drow and I can't help but smile. Despite its late-game flaws, Baldur's Gate 3 is truly special.",0.9,1,ENGLISH
"With a vast world to explore with varied stories and secrets to discover, Baldur's Gate 3 definitely shines. The cast is largely appealing and voice acting is top notch all-around, even if the storytelling and line delivery is varied in its pace. Character progression is somewhat weak in the opening levels but has a strong foundation for a great buildcraft experience, even if it lacks some on the fly experimentation seen in Larian's past efforts. Despite some performance woes in the later parts of the game and controller hangups, this is a journey worth taking for fans of Dungeons &amp; Dragons or those new to the role playing field.",0.9,1,ENGLISH
"A fantastic role-playing game that shines with its story, its companions, its game world and decisions. Only bugs deny an even higher rating.",0.89,1,ENGLISH
"Baldur's Gate 3 is a great cRPG that manages to meet the lofty expectations of the franchise name. With excellent writing, engaging story, flexible player choice and compelling mechanics, even its minor second-half stumbles can't prevent the game from getting some of the highest rolls in the genre.",0.85,1,ENGLISH
"Baldur's Gate 3 is a top game that is definitely worth playing, if you are willing to put in the hours. It's excellently written, excellently acted and shows that you can make a game as big as this without having a drop in quality through things like stupid fetch quests. Of course a game of this size is not without bugs and it is difficult to get into without prior knowledge of Dungeons &amp; Dragons or Divinity, but besides that Baldur's Gate 3 is highly recommended.",0.85,1,ENGLISH

Baldur's Gate 3 isn't a great game. It is a sloppy sketch of a great game.,0.78,1,ENGLISH
"I’m still conflicted with how I feel about Baldur’s Gate III, and I probably will be for a while. While it carries on the legacy of perhaps one of the most influential CRPGs of all time, I’m not sure if it’s better than the first two games that preceded it. It is a different story by a different team and, while it’s deeply connected to those first two games, it is a promising start to more new adventures set in a familiar world that I’ve always loved.",0.7,1,ENGLISH
"For now, I'm simply having a blast learning a lot of complex RPG systems that I've always struggled with in tabletop form.
