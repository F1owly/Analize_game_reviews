"Reynatis offers an interesting story and bloody fights with a dual system between defense and attack that is really engaging, especially in the boss fights with gigantic monsters. Unfortunately, exploring Tokyo and the parallel world Another is not as engaging, since apart from rare situations it turns out to be little more than a walking simulator. Technically it is not excellent, with models and textures that recall what we saw on PS3, but at least there are no slowdowns or dropped frames. If you are looking for a story full of charismatic characters, it could be for you.",0.75,5
Reynatis will seduce you if you're open to forgive a few mistakes (and have a good English skill).,0.7,5
"Reynatis breaks the cardinal rule of not reminding players about better games. Everything from the concept to the gameplay feels like a less engaging version of The World Ends with You, and the fact there's an in-game crossover between the two makes it not feel like a coincidence. There's very little that makes Reynatis stand out, and there are quite a few baffling game design choices. I can see players gleaning some fun from it, but only if they've already experienced its better inspirations.",0.65,5
"Reynatis is close to a master at one trade, with its unique and refreshing combat system. But there’s too many other pieces that drag the overall presentation down, especially with its outdated graphics, poor Switch performance, awkward camera angles, and high price tag. However, even through all its minor to glaring flaws, and believe me there are many, it's an adventure I find myself looking fondly back on the things it does well.",0.65,5
"Reynatis is obviously made by a small team with a lot of passion for the world and concept, but the game’s disparate ideas simply don’t come together into a truly cohesive package. There’s greatness hidden in Reynatis and even bits that I truly loved, like the text conversations, but it all comes with some caveats. I don’t regret the time I spent with Reynatis, and think there could be the spark of something truly interesting if it gets a sequel. But for now, it feels a bit like RPG junk food, satisfying in some ways, but leaving you wanting more.",0.6,5
"Reynatis is a game full of heart that reminds me of the golden age of PS2 RPG adventures, for better and for worse. It's full of interesting ideas, but is lacking consistent execution. If you can see past that, I do think that the charm of the game – the strong character writing, the living city of Shibuya, and angsty JRPG vibe of it all – will really resonate.",0.6,5
"Those that have seen the secret ending for Kingdom Hearts 3 know that Kingdom Hearts 4 could very well be series director Tetsuya Nomura's attempt at making his vision of Versus 13 made real, but I'm so glad that we have Reynatis as another interpretation of that vision, and to be honest, I hope even more developers make their own interpretations of Versus 13. Reynatis is a reality based on fantasy, and though it's far from perfect, that's enough for me.",0.6,5
"Far from being the disaster prophesied by the genre's detractors, but the miracle desired by fans of the great artists involved this time by FuRyu, REYNATIS is a practical demonstration of how, many times, it is not enough to put together brilliant minds to give life to an authentic masterpiece. Indeed, the superficial screenplay by Kazushige Nojima and the repetitive soundtrack composed by Yoko Shimomura almost seem to suggest that not even they fully believed in the goodness of the project, whose most successful elements are hands down the artwork created by Yasutaka Kaburagi. Although limited by an extremely dated technical sector and an almost non-existent level of difficulty, the combat system of REYNATIS is quite intriguing, even if some mechanics could have been implemented with greater conviction. All things considered, REYNATIS takes home a passing grade, however the advice is to wait for the first discount before pouring into the streets of this dystopian reinterpretation of Shibuya.",0.6,5
"A disappointing outcome, especially considering the prestigious names involved in its creation, like Yoko Shimomura and Kazushige Nojima. Despite their contributions, the game fails to live up to its potential, with lackluster storytelling, underdeveloped characters, and repetitive combat mechanics. While the Tokyo-based setting and the political undertones initially seem intriguing, they quickly devolve into shallow execution. The game's graphics, combat system, and soundtrack also suffer from mediocrity. Overall, Reynatis appears to be another missed opportunity from Furyu Corporation, relying on big names but delivering an ultimately forgettable experience.",0.55,5
The story and world-building are definitely the most interesting things about Reynatis but it’s a shame everything else feels so half-baked and repetitive. It’s hard to get invested in the characters when the dull combat makes you want to get through the adventure as quickly as possible.,0.5,5
"Reynatis, the latest action RPG from FuRyu, combines intriguing world-building and fluid combat but falters in storytelling and gameplay depth. Despite contributions from Yoko Shimomura and Kazushige Nojima, the rushed narrative leaves the experience feeling incomplete. The combat mechanics are engaging but lack challenge, while repetitive dungeons and lackluster side quests drag down the pacing. With some polish and deeper storytelling, Reynatis could have been something special, but as it stands, it’s a fun yet flawed journey.",0.5,5

"Reynatis isn't an awful game to play, but it remains a pretty average experience throughout.",0.5,5
"We played Reynatis so you don't have to. Sometimes too much ambition can lead to a wide gap between on-paper ideas and the actual creation and production processes, and this is very well the case. A convoluted story, a lot of technical issues and boring and repetitive gameplay don't do justice to the great soundtrack. ",0.48,5
"I'm not sure what happened with Reynatis. Yoko Shimomura and Kazushige Nojima are legends. It feels like FuRyu had everything they needed to deliver a great JRPG. However, game development is difficult, and some projects are bound to miss the mark. That happened here in a big way. Reynatis is one of the most miserable experiences I have had with a game in decades. It is an ugly, repetitive mess that houses some of the worst writing the medium has to offer. Outside of the OST, there is almost nothing of value here. If this is, in fact, anything like what Final Fantasy Versus 13 was supposed to be, then I can comfortably say that Final Fantasy fans dodged a bullet.",0.2,5
