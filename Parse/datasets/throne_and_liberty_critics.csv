"Throne and Liberty is a full-fledged next-gen RPG thanks to both his impactful visual style as well as an incredibly polished gameplay. The game sets whole new standards for the genre, hence looking like a promising future is ahead. Now it is time to see if Throne and Liberty can truly shine on its own.",0.88,7,ENGLISH
"Like most MMORPGs, the fate of Throne and Liberty will rely heavily on the decisions NCSoft and Amazon Games make in regard to future content. Nothing beats a solid MMORPG launch; and so far, at least the Early Access launch has been incredibly smooth. But the ability to keep meaningful and fun content coming is what keeps players logging in and overall making the MMO feel worth playing. In its current state, you’ll be hard-pressed to find an F2P MMORPG with as much content and polish as Throne and Liberty. If you’ve been looking for something that puts the MMO back into MMORPG, this could be just what you’re looking for.",0.85,7,ENGLISH
"Throne and Liberty meets expectations by combining aspects from other games with its own special style. It's unique because we get to create a character with any class to play as we like. From level 1 to 30, the experience is excellent but the ""End Game"" stuff promise something good but we never know. On the other hand the learning curve can be overwhelming, but NCSoft has achieved something positive, and i hope that players will adapt to this game or we will stop hearing about it in 2 weeks.

"Throne and Liberty would undoubtedly have required a few more months of development to correct the many bugs that plague new players. The universe is clean, the interface and icons are neat, progression is sound and the gameplay is fluid and dynamic. Of course, Throne and Liberty won't be able to compete with the premium tenors of the MMO genre any time soon. But it's got everything it takes to make its mark, with a dynamic open world at its heart, which requires you to exist within it, rather than serve as a dumb launching pad for leveling.",0.8,7,ENGLISH
"Throne and Liberty presents itself as an ambitious and risky proposal to encompass a classic traditional RPG concept with new, more dynamic mechanics and top-notch visuals. The storyline is full of stereotypes, but it’s enjoyable, providing an adventure that includes a massive tutorial to cover various PvP and PvE game modes. It’s a universe to get lost in, but where modern mechanics, giving rewards too quickly, could carry the user to an end where only finds a monotony experience too soon.",0.75,7,ENGLISH
"The game’s world is just gorgeous, lovingly put together, and more than that, is built to the scale of a proper MMO worth your time to try for the price of free. I can very much see Throne and Liberty finding its fans for the things it does well even if it isn’t sweepingly innovative for the genre as a whole, and that’s more than you can say for a lot of new MMOs and MMO-adjacent titles.",0.7,7,ENGLISH
"I have no doubt that Throne and Liberty will find a niche in the MMO community that it somehow speaks to. And I’m happy for those people that they will find something to enjoy here. But for most players, I don’t think Throne and Liberty will have anything valuable.",0.3,7,ENGLISH
"Looking for a new MMO? Throne and Liberty is an easy one to pick up and might just sway genre newcomers, too. I’m not entirely convinced it does anything too different from genre norms, but what it does, it does with a level of polish seldom seen, particularly at this early stage. Will it challenge the heavy hitters? Right now, it’s too early to tell, but it’s off to a good start. [Review in Progress]",-0.01,7,ENGLISH
"But the lackluster story and the unrealized potential of certain mechanics will likely remain that way for some time. They could be expanded on in later updates, but in their present state, they don’t do enough to elevate Throne and Liberty over similar games in the genre. Most MMO players are pretty entrenched in their favorite games. When a new title comes along, it has to offer something special enough to draw players away from their current obsessions...Throne and Liberty doesn't do that, at least not yet. The introduction of multiplayer will certainly force me to reevaluate my experience, but for now, I prefer to look at Throne and Liberty as a fledgling MMO that’s laid a lot of good groundwork, but still has a long way to go.

"There’s a real promise in what stands to be a modern successor to one of the all-time greats of the genre, NCSoft’s Lineage 2. [Review in Progress]",-0.01,7,ENGLISH
