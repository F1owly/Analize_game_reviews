"Miyazaki and his team deliver one of the best video games ever made that elevates open-world, action RPGs to a whole new level.",1.0,2
"Ultimately, Elden Ring revolutionizes the Souls genre for the better. Now I'm looking forward to seeing if expansions will be released to expand the story, but for now, I'm back to continuing touring its exceptional world. ",1.0,2
"For the Dark Souls fan this is a dream come true. For an open-world game this is a strong statement in a stale, oversaturated and by the book field of games. For a videogame, Elden Ring is a triumph right there with every iconic game that came before it. With unparalleled game design and a captivating sense of adventure, this is the best game FromSoftware ever made.",1.0,2
"Apart from the summoning issue that is found when attempting to play with others, Elden Ring is a triumph. It looks great, it plays like a dream and it provides a world in which you can spend hours, just wandering about, picking fights.",1.0,2
"Elden Ring is a crowning achievement for FromSoftware and undoubtedly the very best gameplay experience they've yet delivered - and that's really saying something given this developer's incredible back catalogue. The Lands Between deftly combine breathless open world exploration, stunning artistry, immaculate world-building and wondrous adventure with classic Dark Souls combat and dungeon-crawling, resulting in not just the best Souls game to date, but a candidate for one of the very best video games ever made.",1.0,2
"FromSoftware has combined everything they learned while designing their past games and created something that will stand as a benchmark for years to come. Elden Ring is probably the most accessible game in their Soulsborne series, but it is very difficult. This difficulty and the esoteric nature of their design isn’t for everyone, but if you like fantasy RPGs there is no question as to whether you should give this a try. The amount of enjoyment, excitement, wonder, and reward I have felt while playing this game is unmatched. I don’t think I’ve ever experienced anything like it before. Elden Ring is easily the best game I’ve played so far this year, and I know it’s early but it should be in the discussion when talking about the greatest games of all time.",1.0,2
"Elden Ring rewards your curiosity in many ways, be it items, runes or a pathway to another area, but mostly it’s a story to tell your friends when you are sharing tales around the bonfire. It does not force feed tutorials down your throat, but instead it leans far the opposite way by not telling you much at all and lets you explore and find things out on your own. There is no true quest log, no points of interest on a map or no arrows pointing you in the right direction, so there is a good chance you’ll miss some of the best caves and areas of the game. Because of all of this, Elden Ring is forcing me to find all of that out on my own and it is one of the most rewarding games I have ever played. I will continue to explore the Land Between for many hours to come. I’m just not in a hurry.",1.0,2
"Elden Ring is an epic. With a beautifully designed open world, FromSoftware takes the Souls formula to new heights and crafts a journey that needs to be played.",0.95,2
"Despite some annoying performance issues, Elden Ring is a masterpiece. The combat, enemy variety, exploration, music, and open world are top notch. I’ve been playing it daily across all platforms alongside other games all month, and look forward to doing that all year as I try new builds, help friends, and try to do everything I want in this triumph of a video game.",0.95,2
"Elden Ring manages to draw the player into a fascinating world for many hours, with refined gameplay that fits perfectly with the freedom granted to the player. A sumptuous but imperfect work, which fails to completely overcome some of the historical flaws of Hidetaka Miyazaki's productions. Flaws that, however, can't diminish the scope of a masterpiece destined to leave an indelible mark on the videogame world and to set new standards for the souls-like and open-world genres.",0.92,2
"Elden Ring is a real milestone for its developers and one of the best titles we've played in the last few years. The way it mixes the gameplay from Dark Souls with a highly refined exploration offers a really fresh take on the saturated open world market. Despite some notable technical issues, they don't put a stain in the great taste of what promises to be one of the games that leaves a mark on a whole genre, and maybe, the best game From Software has ever developed. ",0.91,2

"With its new open-world dimension, Elden Ring brilliantly fleshes out FromSoftware's already highly effective formula and offers Souls a spiritual sequel that is both ambitious and accessible. All the new features converge towards this last objective: the open world allows you to arm yourself more than ever with the epic and obligatory fights that the adventure reserves, without having the impression of walking around just to farm. And the best part is that it doesn't compromise the sense of accomplishment so important to the genre. Elden Ring is a complete, mysterious experience, where curiosity is tirelessly renewed by the feeling of discovering something for the first time. All with a sumptuous artistic direction, which makes you want to get lost, to explore. The title also welcomes new features that offer strategic choices in combat, without betraying their requirement. We only regret a slight lack of ambition for certain Legacy Dungeons, as well as the recycling of some assets and bosses. Overall, an exceptional title. ",0.9,2
"Elden Ring offers up a gorgeous open world that is enticing and exciting to explore, along with excellent combat variety, amazing bosses to fight, and intricate dungeons to tackle. It might feel a little familiar, but this could well be FromSoftware’s best game to date. ",0.9,2
Elden Ring is a perfect experience for every souls veteran and its welcoming enough for the newcomers. It is a true evolution of the souls-like type of action RPG.,0.9,2
"The sense of wonder and magic as you make your way around this mysterious and grimly beautiful world is truly extraordinary and while that does taper off somewhat by the time you reach the endgame and have seen more or less everything the game has to offer — several times over, in a lot of cases — but that doesn't detract too much from what will have otherwise been a truly remarkable adventure. Souls haters shouldn't fall for the rebrand as they'll just get burned again — Elden Ring is very much 'just' From doing what From does best, this time performing its greatest hits on the biggest stage to date. And what a wonderful thing that is to witness.",0.9,2

"From Software upped the ante, surpassing even their best efforts that we saw with Sekiro Shadows Die Twice in terms of world building.  Elden Ring is an absolute must-play game for 2022, but set aside some time and some patience.",1.0,2

"A supercut of FromSoft's very best work, transported to a totally new space. Elden Ring is not only a masterpiece by its developer's lofty standards, but in packing so much density into the Lands Between, it lights the path ahead for open-world games in general.",1.0,2
,1.0,2
"What ultimately matters, however, is that Elden Ring succeeds at almost every goal it sets out to achieve. It’s the culmination of years of refinement of FromSoftware’s formula. Mechanically, and thematically, this is a game making a statement: that you can buck industry tendencies even as you adopt their trends. ",1.0,2
"Elden Ring challenged me, captivated me, and enchanted me, an unyielding deluge of discovery and artistic vision unbound. Elden Ring represents a truly amazing combination of various game elements that all come together to create something fascinating, special, and unforgettable. Elden Ring isn’t just the best game this year; it’s one of the best games ever made.",1.0,2
"FromSoftware’s most ambitious title yet, Elden Ring is a glowing spectacle of achievement. A refined open-world format adds unimagined wonder to the game, whilst legacy dungeons will likely go down as some of FromSoftware’s best level design. Beyond that, there are so many improvements to the Souls formula that make this an essential play for fans – this is a game that brings so much to the table, yet somehow leaves nothing out.",1.0,2
"Elden Ring is a massive iteration on what FromSoftware began with the Souls series, bringing its relentlessly challenging combat to an incredible open world that gives us the freedom to choose our own path.",1.0,2
"Elden Ring is a spectacle and a marvel to behold. Although there are some issues, the overall experience remains deeply engaging. It's one of the best open-world games I have ever played.",1.0,2
"There is no way around it; Elden Ring is a masterpiece. From Software's iconic gameplay, set in a vast and wonderful world, sucks us right in and never lets go. Even though the hand-holding is close to zero, Elden Ring will surely attract new players due to its more forgiving openness. A must play.",1.0,2
"Elden Ring absolutely manages to deliver on what was promised, and is, despite some minor annoyances, one of the finest gaming experiences I’ve had in years. That’s not only due to the rock-solid gameplay foundation, with its flexible class system, versatile weapons and progression mechanics. It’s also not only because of the morbid, dense atmosphere and the mysterious, captivating setting. It isn’t even solely the open world, which makes me want to spend every spare second exploring it with its gorgeous, monumental vistas and densely packed locations. Instead, the masterful combination of all these great qualities is what really makes Elden Ring special. Yes, the game has stopped me in my tracks multiple times, forcing me to leave bosses and places for later due to the somewhat slower progression system. But every time it does, it offers up dozens of other locations to test my mettle, become stronger and more skilled. And this cycle of trial and triumph is so immensely engaging that it’s going to keep me entertained for months to come.",1.0,2
"ELDEN RING is the most accessible entry to a FromSoftware title to date, with plenty of things to explore, do, and enjoy. Those even mildly interested by the premise should give it a shot.",1.0,2
Almost nothing compares to Elden Ring in quality and depth. This is a game everyone should try at least once if only to get lost in the Lands Between.,1.0,2
"Elden Ring is a walking example of a 10 out of 10 game that isn’t perfect. No game can be perfect but there is just so much in here to love that it becomes hard to pay attention to its mistakes. Every handful of hours had the game open up more and, every time, I was desperate to keep searching, exploring, conquering. Now, over 100 hours later and two playthroughs, all I want is to discover more of what Elden Ring has in store for me. This isn’t just one of the best From Software titles but one of the best games I’ve ever played and I would be shocked if this didn’t have reverberations on the entire games industry.",1.0,2
"It’s been my sincerest pleasure experiencing FromSoftware’s latest work. Elden Ring is a landmark title that I hope shapes the future of what this industry can do; maybe we can one day point at this time in 2022 and note that this is when gaming took a giant leap. At risk of “laying it on thick” and coming off as hyperbolic, in my more than 30 years of gaming, I have almost never played a title that so neared perfection. I’ve devoted 80 blissful hours to Elden Ring, and at no point was I not enjoying myself or captivated by this world. My wish is that this team continues to receive the support it deserves and graces us with more opportunities to lose ourselves in the fantastic.",0.99,2
"Elden Ring is built upon a huge epic world and it is by farther best game in the Soul series in terms of map extensiveness and operability of battle system. More than just the worthiest successor of the Soul series, this game has broken free from the past shortcomings and constraints of the series and comes as an unparalleled master piece. It is a very enjoyable journey venturing into this world rich in details and full of challenges worth exploring.",0.98,2
"Elden Ring is the culmination of 15 years of work that have allowed From Software to improve, title after title, those consolidated foundations that have already given life to some of the most acclaimed games of all time, united by compelling stories and unparalleled gameplay.",0.97,2

"Overall, Elden Ring is slightly held back by some lacking information in the UI, the uneven nature of the difficulty towards the endgame, and the inconsistent performance on the PC platform. Despite this, it's an incredible experience and will be one of the best games you’ll play this year.",0.95,2
"Any new From Software game comes with a lot of expectations, and Elden Ring delivers. It's a thrilling adventure that provides a wonderful sense of discovery through an expertly crafted world, seamlessly incorporating the excellent combat and encounters the studio is known for. The level of difficulty may be off-putting for some, but Elden Ring is so fantastic that it's absolutely worth fighting through to the end.",0.95,2
Elden Ring is everything we dream of and much more. It is the natural evolution of a franchise that has captivated several generations and is now ready to capture many more. Elden Ring will be the most talked about game of the next decade. It's proof that FromSoftware is a master of its craft and a testament that it dominates the genre it has created. Those who try to do something similar will remain mere imitators: they will never reach the level of sophistication achieved in Elden Ring.,0.95,2
"While no one wants to call Game of the Year in March, Elden Ring stands at the top of a very tall hill. If you play one game this year, make it Elden Ring. ",0.95,2
"Dark Souls fans rejoice! Elden Ring is exactly the game you have been hoping it would be, I think, and it is created in grand style. I feel pretty frustrated that the keyboard controls are either so broken or so poorly laid out that I just couldn’t figure them out, and I spent a lot of time trying to (and where some things lie in the menu system are crazy counterintuitive), and I installed it on two different machines to see if it was a hardware problem (note: didn’t help). Elden Ring actually made me want to go back and play Skyrim again, because it always seemed to me that GUI was very well laid out and just made sense. But for you gamepad guys, sharpen up your sword and get in there. You have blood to spill (a lot of which may be your own).",0.95,2
"Despite some technical glitches, Elden Ring has managed to be a satisfying, surprising and fully-experienced game.",0.95,2
"You will enjoy this game if you can stomach the abuse that Elden Ring dishes out. Even if you cannot, there is so much out there that you can do if you aren't afraid of running from scary fights. Some locations can be less fun than others, and some bosses create skill-based stopgaps. Elden Ring is all about picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and sometimes finding something more enjoyable to do. It's worth the investment.",0.95,2
"Every once in a while, a game comes around that takes the world by storm, becoming an instant classic. Not only is Elden Ring one such game, it is also one of the most profound among them. FromSoftware’s first foray into the open world genre is nothing short of breathtaking. It effortlessly balances exploration and tough-as-nails action gameplay in a way that has seldom been seen before. While not entirely flawless, it manages to instill a sense of wonder that will make even the most hardened of players feel like a kid again. Although it stumbles, Elden Ring is still leaps and bounds ahead of the competition.",0.95,2
"An extraordinary sum of the knowledge From Software gained during the years. A bona fide peak of the soulslike genre, enormous and brutal, and capable of magnifying both the bad aspects of the genre and the good ones. The great parts greatly obscure the bad ones though, making for a game that will be talked about for a long time.",0.94,2
,0.93,2
"Elden Ring is a superb take on the soulslike genre, an astonishing evolution and a decisive step forward for From Software's scale of ambition. Elden Ring is a dream come true for every fan of Miyazaki's works.",0.93,2
"I can't say if Elden Ring will be something genuinely new or more of the same to players who have already battled through the other From Software titles, but playing it felt to me like something I haven't experienced before. I was incredibly stressed, I considered quitting out of frustration several times, but I never stopped having fun and wanting to play just a little bit longer.",0.93,2
"Elden Ring is the sum of FromSoftware's experience, poetics and playful approach: a title in which the undisputed skills of the team converge and explode.",0.92,2
FromSoftware has opened up metaphorically and its bet has paid off. Elden Ring is a solid contender for Game of the Year 2022 despite any technical issues it may have.,0.92,2

"Elden Ring is a fantastic RPG for any hardcore gamer looking for a new world to explore. Combat is weighty and takes place in a wonderfully intriguing world full of dungeons to explore and monsters to battle. The only downside is that its high difficulty will be a stumbling block that will continue to put some players off, despite the improved accessibility that comes with the open-world format.",0.9,2

"An open world action RPG from FromSoftware that reaches new heights, but spends too much time in the familiar.",0.9,2
"With Elden Ring, FromSoftware adds new ingredients to the Dark Souls formula, creating a world that is an absolute masterpiece. Combat remains as fluid as we’re used to, providing us with even more tools to master and ignite our sadomasochistic tendencies. The game's plot is often impenetrable and requires a tremendous investment to decipher it, but they payoff is there, if have the time and soul to endure it.",0.9,2
"FromSoftware returns with all of its traditional offerings in Elden Ring, but the real star of the show is its exceptional open world.",0.9,2
"After having finished my first playthrough of Elden Ring. I immediately want to play it again. I have never experienced that with an open-world game before - usually, I find myself thankful such behemoth games are over. FromSoftware has managed to nimbly incorporate its deliberate and challenging action RPG gameplay into an open world with a huge sense of freedom. The fact that they accomplished this feat without compromising on difficulty or narrative is a true marvel. Managing to also avoid almost all of the pitfalls of conventional open-world design is a step beyond even that. Even if you're fatigued over the familiar trappings of dark fantasy soulslike games in particular, Elden Ring is a masterful refinement of the formula that is the current zenith of its form - and it deserves glowing recognition.  ",0.9,2
"A gorgeous and wonderful open world adventure full of discovery, magic, and the same threat that exemplifies FromSoftware's Souls series. Elden Ring is more than another Dark Souls Game, mixing a natural evolution of the series with an open world concept and a greater level of accessibility for those that want to experience the infamous You Died screen.",0.9,2
"It’s hard to review Elden Ring without being comparative; that’s because Elden Ring is an evolutionary step, not a revolutionary one, and one can’t help but see how it’s built on what came before. Here is a massive undertaking of a game, not for the sake of chasing trends but as the natural progression of the style the company has been fostering for over a decade. It’s amazing how smoothly the transition to open world was and how much of the Souls identity is still present. In the short time since its release, it has already left a cultural mark, no doubt a result of the game’s increased approachability. Even after sifting past all the hype and grandiosity, there’s still an excellent game left and Elden Ring is a clear showcase of FromSoftware’s outstanding expertise in the field. Elden Ring really is just that good.",0.9,2
"Elden Ring is massive, sometimes to its detriment. A thorough walkthrough might take up more than 100 hours to complete, and at some point it becomes clear that From Software did not have enough manpower to produce that much unique content. Still, it remains incredibly addictive even after those 100 hours pass…",0.82,2
"While the technical issues of the barebones PC port and the familiar trappings of the open world formula substantially soured my experience, Elden Ring is still an impressive achievement of fusing compelling world design, exploration and combat. ",0.8,2
"Elden Ring is a new gold standard for open-world game design, dishing out some of the best freeform exploration since The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Curiosity is rewarded at every turn and secrets truly feel secret. For Souls veterans, the number of tools available adds a new level of depth to its combat that makes constant experimentation worthwhile. Even with those strengths, it’s hard to outright ignore the ugly quirks in FromSoftware’s games, which stick out even more on new tech. A stubbornness to fix archaic issues holds back what should be a once-in-a-generation game, but Elden Ring is still a landmark accomplishment in any case.",0.8,2
"Elden Ring is a potentially great game that is hindered by massive performance issues. It doesn’t do anything particularly genre-defining, as it mostly sticks to what FromSoftware always does. It will no doubt please fans of the Dark Souls series. But its lack of accessibility options and somewhat restrictive multiplayer may leave some wanting. Ultimately, I think it will potentially offer a better experience down the line, as the day-one patch has already changed some fundamentals of the game. With no real improvement regarding its performance on PC, Elden Ring is a hard game to recommend until a more stable version is available.",0.7,2
"Elden Ring is a wonderful action-RPG that features thrilling combat, an amazing open world, and tons of replay value. Unfortunately, its PC performance needs work.",0.7,2
"Elden Ring is an experience that will not be forgotten in a hurry. It's a tremendous, hulking, massive achievement but because it is tremendous, hulking and massive, it is one that comes with many caveats. The shelves in CeX and conversations with people who stopped playing at Stormveil castle can certainly attest to some of those caveats. Much like any FromSoftware title, it's not going to be for everybody, but paradoxically it is one of their hardest and one of their most accessible to date. It offers huge value in one package, and perhaps is a little too much value, only becoming clearer when nearing the endgame. Don't be mistaken by the criticism, though. This is a phenomenal achievement with a moment-to-moment that is incredibly engaging and immersive. No doubt it will be deserving of the end-of-year accolades it will inevitably receive. One pushes through Elden Ring as one pushes through life, with all the highs and the lows that it brings.",0.7,2
"That's the thing about Elden Ring, its open world has your back, in its own - often painful - way. Souls has always been about inching through claustrophobic corridors and bashing your skull against whatever's in the way. You compare foreheads with friends, ""Look at this bruise Barry, that's me five hours in"". And Barry would probably peel his hair back and reveal the exact same bruise. Adventures in past Souls games tend to line up, as you're all wandering down the same pathways. But that's not the case with Elden Ring. You might show your bruise to Barry and he'll peel his hair back to reveal a scar or a massive indent or a tattoo of a mouse tustling with a skeleton. Both of may be five hours in but you'll be on totally different trajectories. No matter how hostile the game's world may be, it pushes you to succeed and carve out your own adventures. It is, by far, the most encouraging Souls yet. [RPS Bestest Bests]",-0.01,2
"While this is probably the most accessible game the studio has made, it’s still incredibly demanding. It remains hard as hell, but now you have more options for dealing with the frustrating moments. And not only does it demand your focus and attention in a way few other games do, but now, because it’s so large, it demands much of your time as well. After 40 hours of exploring, I don’t think I’m even close to finishing the game; sometimes, it feels like I’m just getting started. Elden Ring isn’t a game you pop on for an hour a night. It’s a game that consumes you. For me, it’s becoming a lifestyle, something I still think about when I set the controller down.",-0.01,2
"Twenty-five hours in, I still have no idea what I’ll see next. It's a testament to Elden Ring that I'm so excited at the possibilities that remain, but it's also a problem that after all this time, I feel like it needs to show me more than it has so far.",-0.01,2
