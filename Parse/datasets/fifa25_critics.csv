"FC 25 is the first genuinely good FC game in years. A complete tactical overhaul underpins the game’s quality, with sweeping and much-needed changes to Career Mode backing it up, unfortunately, somewhat at the expense of Clubs and Ultimate Team.",0.8,4
"Succeeding where last year's edition fell short, EA Sports FC 25 debuts without loud changes, but with a substantial number of updates that touch almost all of its countless game modes. The improvements made to Career Mode and Clubs were essential, while we were slightly disappointed with Rush and the overall lack of significant changes to Ultimate Team. However, what makes the game bright — and perhaps the most crucial aspect of a football game — is the slow, balanced gameplay with astonishing tactical depth that the Canadian studio managed to deliver this year.",0.8,4
"On the whole, I like the changes to this year's game; FC IQ and the player roles fit into the game well - with the exception of a few lapses - and it simply feels good in your hands. I also really like the new Rush mode, much better than the overly cool Volta, which never really kept me hooked for more than few minutes.",0.8,4
"EA Sports FC 25 builds on the great technological innovations of last year's edition and takes them a little further, making football more realistic and tactical. And you have much more and better control over it all. However, the game doesn't offer any major innovations to convince you that this is the edition you need to pick up.",0.8,4
"EA Sports FC 25 continues along the same path as its predecessor, but with a slightly faster and more decisive pace. The new focus on tactics could be the first step toward a more ambitious vision for the future of the series. Overall, this installment proves to be content-rich, relying on the usual winning features while introducing a new 5v5 mode that adds just the right touch to enhance the overall package. ",0.79,4
"If FC 24 had shaken up some things a bit along with its name, starting with the gameplay, FC 25 has not taken this path at all. The considerable contribution this year is called Rush, a new way of playing 5 against 5 quite well integrated into all game modes alongside the classic 11-a-side football. Because even if the title integrates FC IQ, a new tactical and positioning system for AI players very interesting in Career and Clubs mode for budding managers, the gameplay hardly changes one iota compared to last season. Haters of the last opus may therefore move on, except for lovers of Kings League and Ligue 1. The latter will be able to rejoice to see many players from the French championship modeled unlike last year. Cocorico!",0.75,4
"EA Sports FC 25 takes a useful step forward in simulating real football, with a new tactics system and smarter AI, but the improvements aren’t quite as effective as they could be.",0.7,4
"While FC IQ has elevated the on-pitch experience somewhat, off the pitch FC 25 hasn't really changed at al since last yearl. It's all a bit stagnant, in truth. If EA Sports FC 25 were a football stadium, it'd be Old Trafford - a once majestic beast that’s now in need of some serious work.",0.7,4
"EA FC 25 still plays a fine game of football in all of its online and offline modes, but it's fairly hard to get excited about any of it this year. The new depth to tactics, and ability to switch them up on-the-fly, are welcome additions. However, Rush feels a bit flat and forced, whilst the rest of the modes on offer are overwhelmingly familiar. We can see what EA was going for, and it's worked in some respects, but the focus on Rush, and a lack of big changes elsewhere, make for a bit of an uninspired year in the land of football/soccer.",0.7,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is a better game than FC 24 was in many areas and metrics, where much has been improved, and the addition of Rush is absolutely a highlight. However, I can't turn a blind eye to the technical problems. The game has more bugs than I can remember, the menus feel very sluggish, and I've also seen people get completely black screens when they enter matches in certain game modes. These are things that ruin the gaming experience in what is otherwise a good football game.",0.7,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is the most complete football game in the series, but is it worth the €80 price tag? If you already own FC 24, you won’t miss much. For fans of Rush and Ultimate Team, it might be wise to wait for a price drop.",0.7,4
"Like many sports franchises that release yearly iterations, EA Sports FC 25 is going to be much like the game you remember from last year. While FC IQ and roles do a good job of making tactics feel varied and exciting, there are many adjustments and improvements that need to be made to AI before things feel balanced. When slide comes to tackle, not too much has changed this year.",0.6,4
"EA Sports FC 25 delivers a few bright spots, like the fun and refreshing Rush mode, but stagnating gameplay and incremental improvements leave it feeling like EA continues to play it too safe.",0.6,4
"The gameday experience remains fantastic and properly replicates the atmosphere, while the changes to AI greatly affect the gameplay. These two additions alone make EA SPORTS FC 25 stand out as one of the best in the series.",0.9,4
"It’s easy to dismiss EA Sports FC 25 as a glorified reskin of EA Sports FC 24 – and in many respects, it is – but the customarily small tweaks made to graphics and gameplay add up to a near-perfect sports game experience. This is total football.",0.9,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is an interesting (and more importantly, fun) new edition of the EA Sports football saga, with many small tweaks to the pre-existing game modes and two big new features, Rush and FC IQ. In both cases, it can be said that the target was hit, and that the overall quality stands at very good levels. A few bugs and glitches in the menus do not affect a more than enjoyable gaming ex-perience, which promises to keep fans busy for a long time with careers, multiplayer challenges and trading cards...",0.86,4
"In FC 25, FC IQ provides a welcome strategic overhaul for several FC modes, and Rush is apt to be a big hit for FC online community now with more social options. FC 25 is not a largest leap from FC 24, but definitely a step in the right direction for the franchise.",0.86,4
"EA Sports FC 25 brings the feeling of having more challenging and theoretically fair gameplay. And in the end, that’s what matters. The pursuit of realism is almost utopian – after all, we’re talking about a video game, not a live broadcast of a real match. So, of course, there need to be some more arcade-like elements and mechanics that make the game more fun.",0.86,4
"EA Sports FC 25 has been the game that has received the most serious development among the football games released in recent years. The depth that FC IQ adds to the game and the revolution made in tactical sense will give great pleasure especially for those who like to read the game from the sidelines. However, it should not be forgotten that this is ultimately an EA Sports football game, if it can maintain the same pleasure after a patch or two, EA FC 25 can successfully write its name in the history of football games.",0.85,4
EA Sports FC 25 is one of the better successor of the recent EA Sports FC-history. Rush is a pure joy to play and fits the series well. FC IQ delivers more depth and – despite some balancing-issues – impacts the match-flow significantly.,0.85,4
"EA Sports FC 25 marks a turning point for the better in the renewed football franchise. Of course, it carries some vices from the past, but it is far from those disastrous moments or those that showed a lack of interest among followers of this type of games. We can say that the foundation is being built for a total football experience that satisfies casual and demanding players and that is saying a lot, as it breaks with the mediocre period of recent years. We are sure that this year's installment will have more fun for you and that you will scream with emotion for each goal as if it were real, so, believe it or not, there are more good ones than bad ones this year. Happy start to the football season.",0.85,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is an exceptional soccer simulator, a more realistic and fun experience than in previous years, with welcome adjustments to the on-field action and enhancing the sport's tactical approach like never before. FC 25 is a must-have for fans of the British sport.",0.85,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is the game we hoped for last year. With a slight delay, the Vancouver team has partially restructured the franchise, giving it a refreshed spirit. While it’s still rooted in the classic FIFA formula, the revamped modes add depth and deliver the best single-player experience in years without sacrificing multiplayer or the importance of Ultimate Team. The new HyperMotionV physics and FC IQ tactical engines provide a solid new foundation for the series, enhancing both strategy and visuals. Player models have improved, Rush is a delight, and the overall experience is now more fun, varied, and visually appealing than ever.",0.85,4
"EA SPORTS FC 25 introduces a tactical layer that alters how you play on the pitch. Combined with new PlayStyles, and improved HyperMotion, the game is an authentic representation of the sport. Although there are only small tweaks to systems, each thoughtful change improves your time under the floodlights. Rush injects new life into the multiplayer portion with its fast-paced, 5-a-side matches. While Career Mode still requires more attention, the new features are a step in the right direction. Although FC 25 doesn’t completely reinvent the formula, it successfully refines the gameplay experience, delivering a more immersive, strategic, and enjoyable football simulation that fans of the series will appreciate.",0.84,4
"It's a mixed experience, with moments of enhanced fun thanks to new gameplay features, but also frustrating issues in regards to goalkeeper and tackle behavior. While Rush is a welcome addition, other areas like slow menus, moderate updates to game modes, and weaker tactical options compared to its predecessor fall short. The game shines in terms of visuals and technical performance, running smoothly on PS5, delivering impressive graphics.",0.84,4
"EA Sports FC 25 confirms the solidity of Electronic Arts' modern gaming and content proposal, in a chapter that is starting to show signs of a long-desired revolution. The main game modes do not offer any particular innovations, but are still more integrated with each other thanks to a unified progression system and Rush, which acts as a minimum common denominator integrating equally between Career, Ultimate Team and Club. Volta's replacement is in fact more effective and focused than its predecessor, although in cooperative matches it turns out to be quite confusing and frenetic. In any case, the substantial difference this year is in the gameplay, which maximizes the technological achievements obtained thanks to HypermotionV, FC IQ and Cranium for a more realistic, immersive and engaging digital football experience than ever before: finally, thanks above all to the improvement of Team Tactics and Player Roles, FC 25 embraces a more strategic idea of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;football and less focused on full-throttle speed. Another small and significant step forward towards the definitive leap in quality.",0.82,4
"EA Sports FC 25 offers a very complete experience that comes from presenting an overwhelming amount of content, accompanied by several improvements in different modes, although I think there is still a lot of room for improvement. Essentially, it is a very good game that is limited by a recurring problem: the weight of microtransactions in Ultimate Team.",0.81,4
"EA FC 25 is definitely a game of two halves. Its core is still excellent and endlessly enjoyable, and several new additions have given fresh life to the game. However, it remains held back by age-old issues that have plagued the series year-on-year. Overall it offers an improvement over the previous iteration, and Rush, in particular, is an outstanding addition that I hope will become a core part of the game in years to come, but I just wish that painfully slow menus, an abundance of bugs, and sometimes sluggish gameplay wouldn't hold it back.",0.8,4
"You don’t change a winning team, and that’s almost exactly what EA Sports FC 25 is offering this season. The basis of the precedent is there, with changes that are more like adjustments than profound upheavals. The fun is there, the life of the title always as consistent and finally there is enough new material in each mode to invite you to experience. The big plus is the Rush mode, clearly, and we’ll have to see how EA Sports plans to exploit a well-promoted mode everywhere in the coming months to gauge its potential accurately. In the meantime, deep in love or not in love with the ball, you know what to do in a few days with your money. One more season. ",0.8,4
"It's like a new paint job for a car you've been driving for years, it shines and smells fresh, but it's a highly familiar experience. However, Rush and FC IQ are novelties that deserve high praise in this mission to please Greeks and Trojans.",0.8,4
"EA Sports FC 25 establishes itself as a new evolution in the series. There's nothing revolutionary within the game, but it does add enough incentive to be engaging, despite being ‘same old, same old’. FC IQ has impact, Rush mode is fun and the presentation remains impeccable.",0.8,4
"The criteria for evaluating whether or not you should purchase it depends on your love for the saga, since, if you are looking for the latest news, it is a must-buy that will bring with it hundreds of hours of fun, but if your profile is not that Dude, could you wait a little longer.",0.8,4
"Thanks to a couple of key improvements and changes, EA Spots FC 25 is one of the better iterations that EA Sports' annual football franchise has seen in recent years.",0.8,4
"EA FC 25 might not be the giant leap forward that many fans were hoping for, but its best-in-class visuals and realistic matches still comfortably make it the best football sim on the market. While it’s disappointing that some of its biggest and best additions haven’t been fully capitalized on, it still sets a strong foundation for EA SPORTS to build on in the coming years.",0.8,4
"This is an honest entry into football gaming, the kind you can buy this year and enjoy for two, or three seasons, or however long it takes for EA Sports to add new features worth checking out. Career Mode remains a far cry from Football Manager, and the licensing situation might as well have changed the series name to ""European Football 25"". Odds are it will not get better for a while. FC 25 is like watching football: a mix of great moments, frustration, and occasionally asking yourself ""Why did I put two hours into this"". The answer is that FC 25, like football, is just good fun.",0.8,4
"FC 25's gameplay familiarity may trigger initial disappointment, but career mode tweaks and the brilliant Rush mode soon pull you back in for another year. Ultimate Team, meanwhile, remains divisive as ever – but fans of that mode will love its myriad fan-service additions.",0.8,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is perhaps not the major structural leap forward that its predecessor was – it is, to use the classic phrase, an evolution not a revolution. To get the most out of its major new technical features, you’ll need to really dig down into the depths of the pre-match menu systems – and that’s not for everybody. Meanwhile, Ultimate Teams is as problematic as ever with its carefully greased compulsion loop of in-game purchases and micro-improvements to your fantasy squad.",0.8,4
"The cash cow of Ultimate Team will always override everything else with FC 25, sadly. In an ideal world, EA Sports would develop Clubs into a major eSport, which would do extremely well. Real world soccer clubs around the world could have their own teams, and most importantly, the gameplay would then take priority with Ultimate Team being in the background generating income. Plainly, the game would be much better for it.",0.8,4
"This year's edition solidifies its claim as the best football game around, but it also showcases a need for competition, so there is pressure to iron out some of the frustrating kinks.",0.8,4
"Thanks to the introduction of FC IQ, the on-pitch action in EA Sports FC 25 is more dynamic and authentic than ever before. And while most other changes are small, the replacement of Volta with Rush, a 5v5 match type that is accessible in most game modes, makes this a worthy upgrade from last year's release overall.",0.8,4
"FC25 is an improvement on the previous entry, moving in a positive direction. Ultimate Team continues to be egregious, but Rush is refreshing and fun. Refocusing its gameplay to a more deliberate and slower paced brand of football, that takes tactics into account, makes for a more enjoyable game. With some minor updates, its potential can be fulfilled. FC25 has found its form, and is the best an EA footie title has been in years.",0.8,4
"EA Sports FC 25 makes smart choices so that the time you're spending in the game feels much more worthwhile. Rush is the best addition in years, and hopefully indicative of the future of the franchise. ",0.8,4
"EA Sports FC 25 has a focus on tactics that are mostly noticeable, and while Rush is a cool new mode, it does feel pretty similar to last year.",0.8,4
"EA FC 25 doesn't live up to its launch price. The game has limited improvements, especially in terms of gameplay, which make it only worth it for those who play competitive mode, or for those who can't live without Ultimate Team.",0.8,4
EA SPORTS FC 25 builds up the future of the franchise with a revolution on the tactic side and a great new experience like Rush.,0.8,4
"More realistic gameplay, more tactical depth and the rush mode are welcome, but in no way justify the price tag.",0.76,4
"If FC 24 had shaken up some things a bit along with its name, starting with the gameplay, FC 25 has not taken this path at all. The considerable contribution this year is called Rush, a new way of playing 5 against 5 quite well integrated into all game modes alongside the classic 11-a-side football. Because even if the title integrates FC IQ, a new tactical and positioning system for AI players very interesting in Career and Clubs mode for budding managers, the gameplay hardly changes one iota compared to last season. Haters of the last opus may therefore move on, except for lovers of Kings League and Ligue 1. The latter will be able to rejoice to see many players from the French championship modeled unlike last year. Cocorico!",0.75,4
"EA Sports FC 25 looks, feels, and plays like a truly upgraded version of the franchise. It isn’t a perfect sports simulator, but it does a great job of making the game feel alive and takes another step forward for the franchise.",0.75,4
"FC 25 is an enjoyable, yet unexciting entry with welcome additions such Rush and big updates to Manager Career. Those expecting notable changes anywhere else will be left disappointed, though there’s more than enough here to keep the annual title kicking along.",0.75,4
"EA Sports FC 25 follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, adding a number of welcome details such as the arrival of women in the career mode and the rush mode, not forgetting the roles that add an ever more tactical edge to your matches. However, the experience is spoiled in part by the many problems that remain, which can clearly discourage many. In the end, we wouldn't recommend the version as it stands, given that it's more of an update to FC 24 than a new game in its own right. Prefer a console version if you really want to buy it.",0.75,4
"Playing EA Sports FC 25 provided lots of fun. The new things are cool, the online matches go on without problems, and crossplay guarantees rivalry between people with different platforms. But I can't look past all the technical issues - if not for them, the final grade would be higher.",0.75,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is especially fun for players who like to tactically control the game thanks to a series of new options. In addition, the game has an enormously wide range with the introduction of a simulation mode and Rush. FC 25 still has some rough edges that prevent us from dealing with a championship-worthy selection.",0.75,4
"EA Sports FC 25 has cut the amount of innovations to the bone compared to last year, although the scope of some of them is bound to make a lasting impression on hardcore soccer aficionados. FC IQ might be the strongest new feature in years, but it's also so easy to miss it that people will probably dub it yet another more of the same - and understandably so, given the shortage of surface-level additions.",0.7,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is an excellent improvement over its predecessor in many areas. Rush mode – especially when played with friends – is brilliant at times and brings back the fun of EA’s football game. However, the game has too many issues to truly impress us. The gameplay and FC IQ are well-designed, but the servers are often so poor that everything feels sluggish. Both the menus and the online gameplay feel very slow, although that still doesn't stop us from enjoying FC 25 quite a bit.",0.7,4
"The two main innovations in FC 25, namely Rush mode and the FC IQ system, really hit the mark. However, the other significant changes can be counted on the fingers of one hand. If you liked FC 24, you will certainly like FC 25, but if you were not a fan of the previous installment, you will probably not have a good time here.",0.7,4
"EA FC 25 offers a much more polished gameplay and adds enough details to make the experience at the controls much better. In addition, the new career mode is now more interesting and deeper for those of us who enjoy creating our own legacy.",0.7,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is a slightly better offering than FC 24, thanks to the new Rush mode. FC IQ is still in its early stages and while it could have a huge impact on future titles, it is not yet very apparent how it is impacting the on the pitch action in this game. This is the EA Sports FC as you already know it. Whether that is a good or bad thing is up to you.",0.7,4
"EA FC 25 shines for its tactical realism and Career Coach mode, but stumbles over an ageing interface and on-field gameplay that struggles to convince unless you switch to simulator mode.",0.7,4
"EA FC 25 is a fickle title. For every two steps forward, EA takes one step back and one step sideways. Although it's still an improvement on last year's release, it's not a significant enough evolution to dispel the idea that it's the same game every year. That's what you get when you play to manage the score.",0.7,4
"Same procedure as every year... a few optimizations here and there, but unfortunately also noticeable improvements that make things worse. If you don't need UT, you can stick with EA FC 24.",0.7,4
Quotation forthcoming.,0.7,4
"EA is playing a better game than last year. That’s not to say that EA Sports FC 25 is suddenly a classic footie or anything – far from it; this is no Fifa 17, let alone PES 5 or Sensible Soccer. But hey, the bar is just not set very high in 2024.",0.65,4
"It is a bit difficult to rate this game. Mechanically, this is a good game. The football fits like a shot, but if you bought last year's edition, I'm not quite sure if I can in good conscience recommend you buy this...EA Sports FC 25 is the best soccer game on the market, but primarily because there are no real alternatives.",0.6,4
"If FC 24 had shaken up some things a bit along with its name, starting with the gameplay, FC 25 has not taken this path at all. The considerable contribution this year is called Rush, a new way of playing 5 against 5 quite well integrated into all game modes alongside the classic 11-a-side football. Because even if the title integrates FC IQ, a new tactical and positioning system for AI players very interesting in Career and Clubs mode for budding managers, the gameplay hardly changes one iota compared to last season. Haters of the last opus may therefore move on, except for lovers of Kings League and Ligue 1. The latter will be able to rejoice to see many players from the French championship modeled unlike last year. Cocorico!",0.75,4
"EA FC 25 feels like possession soccer devoid of ideas - lots of control, but too little real innovation.",0.74,4
"EA Sports FC 25 continues to hand in the same homework it's done for the past few years now, albeit with a new paragraph on Rush. It's a solid game that will likely enjoy plenty of additions throughout the year, but I'd like to see more ambition in the future.",0.7,4
"There's a lot to like about EA FC 25, from the overhauled tactics to the chaotic addition of Rush and a few welcome improvements to Career mode. It's not a resounding victory, however. The on-field action has stagnated, maintaining its quality but also plenty of its flaws, while changes to Ultimate Team feel antagonistic in their design. In the near future, issues like input lag and its propensity to crash will hopefully be fixed, but the same is unlikely to be true for its long-standing problems. At the end of the day--to borrow common football player lingo--there's fun to be had with EA FC 25, especially if you enjoyed last year's game, but rather than taking a significant leap forward, it's content to settle for midtable form.",0.6,4
"It’s a bit like Serie A in that way then, is FC25. And while I remain privately furious that the move away from the FIFA licence seems to have left EA without the adequate rights for some of Serie A’s best teams (honestly, you should see the ‘We have AC Milan at home’ travesties in place of the licensed teams), I am pleased to say I’ve had more raw, honest enjoyment with FC25 than I have any of its recent predecessors. Partly because it feels like the PC port got the required amount of love this year, and partly because I feel just slightly more empowered to play a different style of football this year. In my heart of hearts, I know that this inch-by-inch progress doesn’t justify £50 on a ‘new’ game every year. But here I am, playing it anyway and enjoying it like a comfy old favourite jumper that’s just had the elbows repaired.",-0.01,4
