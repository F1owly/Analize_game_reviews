"Throne and Liberty is a full-fledged next-gen RPG thanks to both his impactful visual style as well as an incredibly polished gameplay. The game sets whole new standards for the genre, hence looking like a promising future is ahead. Now it is time to see if Throne and Liberty can truly shine on its own.",0.88,7
"Like most MMORPGs, the fate of Throne and Liberty will rely heavily on the decisions NCSoft and Amazon Games make in regard to future content. Nothing beats a solid MMORPG launch; and so far, at least the Early Access launch has been incredibly smooth. But the ability to keep meaningful and fun content coming is what keeps players logging in and overall making the MMO feel worth playing. In its current state, you’ll be hard-pressed to find an F2P MMORPG with as much content and polish as Throne and Liberty. If you’ve been looking for something that puts the MMO back into MMORPG, this could be just what you’re looking for.",0.85,7
"Throne and Liberty meets expectations by combining aspects from other games with its own special style. It's unique because we get to create a character with any class to play as we like. From level 1 to 30, the experience is excellent but the ""End Game"" stuff promise something good but we never know. On the other hand the learning curve can be overwhelming, but NCSoft has achieved something positive, and i hope that players will adapt to this game or we will stop hearing about it in 2 weeks. ",0.83,7
"Throne and Liberty would undoubtedly have required a few more months of development to correct the many bugs that plague new players. The universe is clean, the interface and icons are neat, progression is sound and the gameplay is fluid and dynamic. Of course, Throne and Liberty won't be able to compete with the premium tenors of the MMO genre any time soon. But it's got everything it takes to make its mark, with a dynamic open world at its heart, which requires you to exist within it, rather than serve as a dumb launching pad for leveling.",0.8,7
"Throne and Liberty presents itself as an ambitious and risky proposal to encompass a classic traditional RPG concept with new, more dynamic mechanics and top-notch visuals. The storyline is full of stereotypes, but it’s enjoyable, providing an adventure that includes a massive tutorial to cover various PvP and PvE game modes. It’s a universe to get lost in, but where modern mechanics, giving rewards too quickly, could carry the user to an end where only finds a monotony experience too soon.",0.75,7
"The game’s world is just gorgeous, lovingly put together, and more than that, is built to the scale of a proper MMO worth your time to try for the price of free. I can very much see Throne and Liberty finding its fans for the things it does well even if it isn’t sweepingly innovative for the genre as a whole, and that’s more than you can say for a lot of new MMOs and MMO-adjacent titles.",0.7,7
"I have no doubt that Throne and Liberty will find a niche in the MMO community that it somehow speaks to. And I’m happy for those people that they will find something to enjoy here. But for most players, I don’t think Throne and Liberty will have anything valuable.",0.3,7
"Looking for a new MMO? Throne and Liberty is an easy one to pick up and might just sway genre newcomers, too. I’m not entirely convinced it does anything too different from genre norms, but what it does, it does with a level of polish seldom seen, particularly at this early stage. Will it challenge the heavy hitters? Right now, it’s too early to tell, but it’s off to a good start. [Review in Progress]",-0.01,7
"But the lackluster story and the unrealized potential of certain mechanics will likely remain that way for some time. They could be expanded on in later updates, but in their present state, they don’t do enough to elevate Throne and Liberty over similar games in the genre. Most MMO players are pretty entrenched in their favorite games. When a new title comes along, it has to offer something special enough to draw players away from their current obsessions...Throne and Liberty doesn't do that, at least not yet. The introduction of multiplayer will certainly force me to reevaluate my experience, but for now, I prefer to look at Throne and Liberty as a fledgling MMO that’s laid a lot of good groundwork, but still has a long way to go. [Review in Progress]",-0.01,7
"There’s a real promise in what stands to be a modern successor to one of the all-time greats of the genre, NCSoft’s Lineage 2. [Review in Progress]",-0.01,7
"While Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom successfully brought exciting new concepts to Nintendo's iconic series and helped revolutionize open-world games – Echoes of Wisdom feels like a big step forward for classic Zelda. The game is a punchy cocktail of old school Zelda, expertly blended with modern mechanics from the series’ two open-world giants. As a result, Nintendo has created something that feels both nostalgic and uniquely fresh…It may have taken 38 years for the series's titular princess to finally get her own game, but boy was it worth waiting for. Echoes of Wisdom not only demonstrates that Nintendo is capable of wowing Zelda fans, but it can breathe new life into its legendary series. Echoes of Wisdom is a resounding success, a masterclass in creativity, and a worthy debut title for the series’ legendary princess.",1.0,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is the perfect Legend of Zelda game. Where Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom took the series in new directions, to the point that they're barely related to what came before them, Zelda’s first outing as a protagonist feels like it fits seamlessly in with the traditions of Ocarina of Time, Link’s Awakening and Link to the Past. Not only that, but Nintendo has built a gameplay system that is more whimsical and creative than any of those previous titles, making this a more complete and fully realised vision of what the series has always wanted to be. I desperately hope that this wasn’t just a one-off experiment, and The Legend of Link is here to stay.",1.0,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom features all of the amazing hallmarks of the series, yet feels completely innovative, unique, and fresh.",1.0,6
"Long-time Zelda players will be smiling from ear to ear when they roll credits. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is full of wonderful surprises, engaging gameplay, and tons of stuff to do in the biggest top-down iteration of Hyrule yet.",1.0,6
"The perfect evolution for the Zelda series. It feels, in every way, like this is Zelda’s story, and this game does a great job of proving that there are many different ways to be a hero.",1.0,6
"Echoes of Wisdom is a great send-off to The Legend of Zelda's most successful era. The game is the ending point for a very clear path started by Breath of the Wild and continued in Tears of The Kingdom, of games that have an unyielding faith in the player's ability to solve problems in very creative ways. All of that is combined with the structure of classic 2D-era Zelda games.",1.0,6
"You’ll find yourself quickly and expertly tossing pots to distract baddies, stacking boxes and tables for extra height and firing out little green critters to fight for you, while you run around enemies to escape. It’s a joy to play, looks great and an excellently crafted mashup of gaming ideas to deliver a fresh-feeling new Zelda.",1.0,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has managed to surprise me by mixing the limitless creativity that the 3D games of the franchise have been offering with the classic flavor of the two-dimensional Zelda games. Playing as Princess Zelda is a breath of fresh air, and mechanics such as creating Echoes or Bind give room for many possibilities.",0.97,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom elegantly bridges old and new Zelda with grace and gusto. The Echoes system is inventive, the dungeon designs are strong and the whole experience feels like everything a classic Zelda experience should be. While minor performance issues hold Echoes of Wisdom back from being everything it could be, they're only minor blemishes on an otherwise stellar adventure fit for a princess.",0.95,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom feels like the perfect compromise between old and new. It incorporates some of the best elements of open-world design from the more recent 3D titles into the solid linear structures of the classic 2D instalments to create something that feels familiar without being too stale, and structured without being restrictive. No matter what your history with the series is, you’d be wise to check this one out. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom launches for Nintendo Switch on 26 September 2024.",0.95,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a game with a considerably smaller scale than the last two installments in the series and therefore, with much more earthly goals and objectives, however, Grezzo brings to the table a title with a lot of proposal that knew perfectly how to mix the whole new philosophy of the franchise, with its oldest and most beloved traditions by fans. This opens a completely new line of thought that tells us that smaller-sized The Legend of Zelda also have a place in the future. Needless to say, we are facing one of the great video games of this very strong 2024, one that of course, you shouldn't miss for anything.",0.95,6
"Echoes of Wisdom offers a variety of clever puzzles that go hand in hand with its excellent gameplay and charming story, which looks and feels like it came straight out of a cozy fairytale. It's nothing short of a highly memorable and fulfilling experience.  ",0.95,6
"Anarchic, exciting and at times ingenious: The Legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom is an adventure that will test your brains without overstressing your fingertips. It doesn't last long and hardcore gamers will perhaps complete it too quickly, but the journey is sensational and enveloped in the usual ‘made in Nintendo’ magic that makes it a must-have in any case.",0.93,6
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom reclaims the relevance of the games with this perspective within the franchise. Leaving Link aside allows us to play a fresh formula that at the same time remains recognizable.,0.92,6
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom cleverly combines the format of classic installments with the style of modern ones; a link between the past and the future of the saga that also brings home-grown ideas full of possibilities and freshness. The princess has shown why she has always been HER legend.,0.91,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is the twist on the old Zelda formula that we've been craving. Classic systems like a large number of dungeons are still present, while the magic system makes for an incredible array of solutions to your problems. The named downsides, like the unintuitive item menu and the framedrops, are annoying, but otherwise do not bother this solid game.",0.9,6
"It may have taken nearly four decades, but the first mainline Zelda game with the titular princess in the lead role was worth the wait. This is a magnificent adventure that whizzes and pops with imagination, and proudly stands shoulder to shoulder with the very best of Link’s tales. If this is the Switch’s final Zelda game - and surely it has to be - then we’re going out on a high.",0.9,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a gorgeous, brilliantly clever game in a series that continues to be unique and innovative.",0.9,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom proves that a classic approach to the series is still possible as long as it only partially negates the evolutions of recent years. The new gameplay mechanics blend perfectly with the old-school structure and are fun, while the art direction takes your breath away.",0.9,6
"The new Zelda game, where you finally play as Zelda, offers an unexpectedly grand adventure, blending the best of the series' 2D titles with crafting-like mechanics inspired by Tears of the Kingdom. Echoes of Wisdom is more than a spin-off or mish-mash of previous concepts – it’s a well-crafted, refreshing addition to the legendary series.",0.9,6
"Where Link’s Awakening already looked fantastic and sounded even better, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has all of that, but with a unique gameplay concept on top. The ability to learn and copy objects and enemies adds so much more depth than you might expect at first glance. It seems like multiple solutions are possible for everything, and you might have a completely different approach to most of the game than I do. Selecting the Echoes is somewhat awkward, and this user interface is the biggest criticism I have of the game. By limiting direct combat, you’re forced to think differently, and in most cases, this works out well, though it can be frustrating at times. Beyond that, you’ll find a wonderfully traditional Zelda adventure full of secrets, great dungeons, and boss fights, but filled with small environment-based puzzles and challenges.",0.9,6
"Subverting the franchise's standard narrative, Echoes of Wisdom sets the titular princess out to save the kingdom - and Link - from the forces of evil. Even without wielding a sword and shield at all times, Zelda uses the greatest weapon she possesses: wisdom, and there's nothing more “Zelda” than that.",0.9,6
"Nintendo reimagines The Legend of Zelda series by using Zelda herself, creating an adventure very different from those of Link. It's clever and rewarding, offering almost complete freedom to experiment and turning this ""classic Zelda"" into a revolution of 2D sandbox games.",0.9,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom should be the new standard for top-down Zelda going forward. Rather than abandoning the classic formula, Zelda has shown that the old and the new can come together and produce wonderful results that reward experimentation and reinforce the joy of play. This is easily in contention with A Link to the Past and A Link Between Worlds as one of the best top-down adventures in the series, and we hope we don’t need to wait another 35 years for Zelda to take a starring role again.",0.9,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom gives Princess Zelda a starring role, combining new and classic elements to deliver an inventive title that's one of the most delightful in the series yet.",0.9,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom gives the princess a worthy game, with a brilliant gameplay mechanic that, despite technical flaws, stimulates your brain in a classic way.",0.9,6
"Even with this overabundance of options, and even considering the technical limitations and simplicity mentioned above, it's hard not to play Echoes of Wisdom and think, ""This is what I've been waiting for.",0.9,6
The Legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom is a unique new addition to the Zelda family. It’s wonderful to see the same boundless creativity celebrated in a smaller-scale title.,0.9,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom may not be a game for everyone. Maybe not even a game for every Zelda fan. It does things differently, turns the traditional formula on its head and asks you to do something other than traditional combat. But that's what impressed me about it. It's not trying to do the same thing that worked five years ago. It's building on that, but it's doing something new, something fresh and something interesting that's hard to tear yourself away from.",0.9,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom brings some new ideas to the table, but in the end, the game is more about modernizing the classic 2D Zelda experience. The attention-grabbing echo copying mechanic has its pros and cons, but where Echoes of Wisdom consistently hits is in the tried-and-true design of its world and dungeons, which are as good as any the franchise has delivered in the past. This may be Zelda's first starring adventure, but past Legends still echo strongly here.",0.9,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is the Zelda game I’ve always wanted, putting Hyrule’s princess into the thick of it for the first time and coming up with incredible results. The gameplay loop is phenomenal, the story is lovely, and with any luck this will be the first of many adventures for the Zelda series’ leading lady. ",0.9,6
"If Zelda's debut in the spotlight is a one-off, at least it's a memorable adventure. But hopefully this is the beginning of a new legend for the heroine. Echoes of Wisdom's brilliantly integrates echoes system links two eras, proving that the freeform mechanics of the new age can coexist with the franchise's classic formula. Don't mistake this for a spin-off or minor entry between big ""mainline"" games: The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a major moment that shouldn't be missed.",0.9,6
"Ultimately, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom can be considered a successful experiment. Playing as the princess is not only genuinely fun, but it offers a new perspective on the entire imaginary of the kingdom of Hyrule. The mechanics of the replicas interact perfectly with the possibility of seeing Zelda in the role of swordswoman, while the ideas related to physical principles further enrich the gameplay. In Echoes of Wisdom, male and female players can adopt the approach they prefer, favoring exploration, use of ingenuity or use of bizarre weapons, equipment and accessories. An excellent adventure, which with a more refined artistic sector and a greater refinement of interfaces and technical aspects could have been a complete masterpiece. If you have a Nintendo Switch on your home table, however, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a very valid reason to grab the joy-con and enjoy the genuine fun offered by the kingdom of Hyrule.",0.9,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom doesn't quite manage to deliver the level of freedom seen in 3D entries like Tears of the Kingdom, but it's hard to complain about some rigid puzzle elements when the game has opened things up so much. Clearly, Nintendo's developers are looking for ways to blend the new and old, and this is another part of that journey. The Echo system is a pleasure to use, the world is more attractive than the last Zelda game, and there's a lot of content in this package. The result is a 2D Zelda game perfectly tailored for fans that first discovered the series with Breath of the Wild. That said, whether you're a longtime Zelda fan, or someone newer to the series, Echoes of Wisdom is a bold step forward for the 2D entries in the franchise. It took decades for Zelda to have a great game to call her own, but the result is worth celebrating. ",0.9,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is far more than some second-tier spinoff, combining the expertly crafted dungeons and item progression you’d expect from a 2D Zelda with the wild creativity provided by Tears of the Kingdom.",0.9,6
"On almost every level, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a delight. Its art style begs for your attention at every turn and I couldn’t get enough of the Echoes system, always eager to explore new combinations to overcome the next challenge. Given the dramatic shift that Breath of Wild brought to the series, Echoes of Wisdom feels like the perfect answer in kind for the top-down Zelda titles, expanding the gameplay in a whole new way whilst maintaining the core look of the franchise so that existing fans don’t feel too isolated. It may have taken a long time for Zelda to star in the leading role, but for it to finally come about in Echoes of Wisdom, the wait was most certainly worth it.",0.9,6
"A perfectly-paced, delightful twist on the classic 2D Zelda formula, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom takes everything Nintendo has learned from the Switch era and condenses it into a tight adventure jam-packed with heart. Through its wonderfully magical Echoes mechanic, satisfyingly diverse dungeon design, and unique blend of modern and classic design elements, this is both a celebration of the franchise’s history and a bold first offering for Zelda as protagonist. Performance issues aside, Echoes of Wisdom is impossible not to love for newcomers and series veterans alike.",0.9,6
"After Princess Peach’s turn in the spotlight, Princess Zelda readily demonstrates that she is more than capable of saving her own kingdom. Grezzo should be incredibly proud of what they have achieved here, delivering a complete reinvention of what awaits us in a top-down adventure across the kingdom of Hyrule with an experience in which past and present collide that succeeds in repeatedly subverting your expectations.",0.9,6
"Echoes of Wisdom is an exemplary game. It has completely obliterated the limitations of the old top-down Zelda formula and will have huge gameplay ramifications for the next generation of Legend of Zelda games, whatever form they take (Zelda Maker seems so obvious). It’s heartbreaking to see some control oversights and the glossy plastic art direction hampered slightly by the technical wobbles. I barely cared, though. I just wonder how I’ll be able to go back to the overhead adventures of the little green-hooded twink after this. ",0.9,6
Echoes of Wisdom is a marvel both visually and gameplay-wise. It's riddled with clever puzzles and gives you total freedom to choose to save Hyrule in your own way. An outstanding experience marred only by a few usability issues.,0.9,6
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom brings a delightful entry to the classic franchise with Princess Zelda as the leading lady. Use your wits and a catalog of echoes in an incredibly well-rounded game to rediscover every corner of Hyrule in a new story.,0.9,6
"This is the best '2D' The Legend of Zelda in recent decades: it offers an adventure of rare charm and overflowing creativity, giving the player great freedom without ever losing sight of the intuitiveness of the mechanics, and without allowing them the ability to undermine the meticulous level design of the game. The bold hybridization between the classic formula and the open-air approach could shape the future of the series.",0.9,6
Quotation forthcoming.,0.9,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom offers an excellent, classic Zelda game experience. The main idea of the game is very fun, as it gives players unlimited options in how to tackle the puzzles and confront enemies; You will not find two players playing the game in the same way.",0.9,6
"Nintendo takes a bold step by making Zelda the central playable character, introducing fresh mechanics that distinguish the game from previous entries in the series. While the story lacks surprises and the Echo selection menu can be frustrating, the game excels with creative puzzles, engaging combat, and flexibility that caters to both series fans and newcomers.",0.9,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom offers a fresh perspective on the series, boldly blending traditional elements with modern innovations while finally giving Princess Zelda the lead role. Her unique abilities bring a new layer of creativity to puzzle-solving and combat, encouraging exploration with inventive solutions. Despite minor technical issues and a cluttered Echoes menu, this new Zelda installment takes the franchise in a promising direction.",0.9,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a lovely way to return to Hyrule, and the echo system revitalizes the experience of exploring this world. From combat to exploration, your approaches will be wildly different from any Zelda game before, and that’s what makes Echoes of Wisdom worth playing. While it’s not quite a Zelda masterpiece, it’s definitely an essential Nintendo Switch game.",0.9,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom presents us with an adventure that we will remember for a long time, where Princess Zelda is the protagonist, and you will rely on your wit to navigate dungeons in multiple ways. This kind of freedom is changing TLOZ into a gaming offering that anyone can enjoy.",0.9,6
"Echoes of Wisdom is a great maiden adventure for Zelda, marrying old and new convincingly, and setting up a foundation for 2D Zelda games to thrive alongside their bigger 3D cousins.",0.9,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is simply delightful and is how every top-down Zelda game should feel like. It’s not huge in the scale of Tears of the Kingdom in size or depth, but it still manages to give you plenty of hours of fun, exploration, and wonder that make it an influential entry in the Legend of Zelda series.",0.9,6
Echoes of Wisdom is yet another stunning entry in the Zelda franchise and those looking for a new Zelda experience but also clamour for something different should give this title a definite try.,0.9,6
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom blends Zelda tradition and modernity into an all-round harmonious and beautiful package.,0.88,6
"To get a game this innovative, charming and polished over a year after the remarkable “Tears” is miraculous.",0.88,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has the potential to become a whole new series on its own thanks to the many possibilities that Zelda introduces as the main character, both narratively and gameplay-wise. It may not be the most ambitious entry in the franchise, and it definitely has some flaws, but even so there's a very big chance for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom to become a fan favorite game.",0.87,6
"While the world and story of Echoes of Wisdom are a lot like what you're used to seeing when playing as Link, Zelda's distinct abilities make for a fairly different experience. Selecting an Echo is clunky at times, but each can be used creatively as a solution to a myriad of clever puzzles. Performance leaves something to be desired, but the princess' first outing as protagonist is a strong one.",0.87,6
"Echoes of Wisdom lays the groundwork for the future of the Zelda series, offering a beautiful and exhilarating experience that blends classic elements with forward-thinking design.",0.87,6
"Echoes of Wisdom is a great new dye entry in the series that combines a very classical approach with creative gameplay where (generally) much more than one way leads to a solution. You will never ask yourself why Nintendo decided to give Zelda the main role. After playing this, you will ask why she did not get her chance earlier. A must-buy for series' fans.",0.86,6
"Even though I love this franchise a lot, innovation is always welcome. The echo system is a fascinating blend of new ideas and established concepts. Using random objects and enemies isn't totally new, but making them the main form of offense is. Transplanting 3D ideas into a 2D plain is a tough challenge, but the devs have handled it nicely. I wish the echoes were easier to scroll through, and the combat could have been harder. But I loved exploring every inch of this world. Even after the credits rolled, I still went back for more. If you're looking for something charming and unusual, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is right on the money.",0.85,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is not a second-rate copy of a Link adventure. It is indeed a new episode of the saga in its own right which also has the heavy task of following Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, both considered masterpieces. Although it is less ambitious and displays a very withdrawn narrative, Echoes of Wisdom manages to offer attractive gameplay based on reflection. It is cleverly concealed by a universe that is still as rich as ever, intended for both long-time fans of the series and newcomers. It is also through its additional content that it shines, which for us is only optional in name as it encourages creativity. With Echoes of Wisdom, the legend of Zelda has truly moved into a new dimension with an episode that brilliantly brings together the old and the modern. It is, without a doubt, the essential Nintendo game of 2024.",0.85,6
"Echoes of Wisdom is a fantastic game that skillfully redefines the classic 2D Zelda formula, while taking inspiration from other games in the series. These changes will be noticed mostly by veterans, but even new players will find lots of fun here.",0.85,6
"Zelda's first adventure is colorful, cute and surprisingly versatile fun. Dozens of echoes provide variety, the friendly game world and Zelda-typical puzzle fun do the rest.",0.85,6
"The Legend of Zelda once again manages to renew itself brilliantly, thanks to a strong concept executed with care. You can always complain about the outdated interface or the technical limitations that hinder progress at regular intervals, but the power of the Echoes and the freedom given to players to solve the puzzles sweep these minor flaws under the carpet. A very good game, far from perfect, but highly recommended.",0.85,6
"Zelda's great adventure is packed with beautiful stories. A highlight for every Switch collection! However, we have to lower our score because of technical issues: the heavily fluctuating frame rate, especially in docked mode, spoils the fun.",0.83,6
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom takes the best things from its Switch counterparts—and a few of the bad ones—and creates an incredible unique free-form top-down experience.,0.8,6
"Is Echoes of Wisdom the perfect blend of old and new? Not quite, because despite the great freedom, some echoes are simply more reliable than others, which makes you wonder if the great freedom is really necessary? Nevertheless, the Princess' debut game is the best example yet of a Zelda game where two very different design philosophies are allowed to compliment and not trump each other, which is why it can be recommended to all fans, new and old.",0.8,6
"Echoes of Wisdom proves that even after nearly 40 years, The Legend of Zelda still has room to surprise us... Echoes of Wisdom feels like the Zelda-fronted game I’ve been waiting decades for. I only hope this isn’t her last turn as the series’ star.",0.8,6
"Despite how much joy I mined conquering its temples and delving into its many rifts, at times it doesn’t push its ambition far enough. That never stops Echoes from being a warm hug of a video game that enraptured me from start to finish, but it does leave me infinitely more curious about what the future holds. Now Zelda has helmed her first epic outing, it’s only a matter of time until she goes onto bigger and better things.",0.8,6
"Although it's a mostly great experience, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a clear step below the S-tier Zelda games like Twilight Princess, Tears of the Kingdom, and so forth. There's still plenty of fun to be had if you're a fan of the classic Zelda games and perhaps this return to that formula is the shake-up that the series needed following Tears of the Kingdom.",0.8,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a charming delight, an adventure for Zelda herself that embraces a wholly different style of gameplay to Link's tales, allowing for player expression and creativity throughout.",0.8,6
"Thanks to playful puzzles and an imaginative reinvention of Hyrule's historic iconography, Echoes of Wisdom emerges as a bold and creative new chapter in Zelda's legend.",0.8,6
"Really, Echoes of Wisdom feels like the perfect sign-off for the Switch with new hardware reportedly on the horizon. It’s a colourful, accessible epic that pushes its console to the limit, with all of the mechanical depth and invention, artistic design, whimsy, and spirit of adventure that you expect from a first-party Nintendo adventure.",0.8,6
At times inconsistent and unrefined but the echoes concept is excellent and allows for one of the most innovative and open-ended 2D Zeldas of the modern era.,0.8,6
"In all, Nintendo and Grezzo have pulled off a surprisingly refreshing retooling of the Link's Awakening engine. All hail Princess Zelda.",0.8,6
Echoes of Wisdom introduces refreshing ideas but it can't keep up the initial excitement.,0.8,6
"This isn’t the swashbuckling, swords-first sort of game that The Legend of Zelda players have been given in the past, and that’s a wonderful thing. With a dose of whimsy and some very clever ideas, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom makes a memorable, exceedingly lovely impression. ",0.8,6
"The result is a game that is the definition of a truly mixed experience - but if you take the rough and under-developed with the smooth and innovative, there’s a lot of fun to be had. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is perhaps a victim of being part of a series that has one of the highest batting averages of any franchise out there - what is ‘good’ by Zelda standards is great to many other franchises and publishers. This is by no means the earth-shaker that some Zelda games are - but it sits up there with many other classic 2D Zeldas just fine. I just wish Zelda herself felt a bit more defined and present throughout, given this is her first true playable debut. ",0.8,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a charming follow-up to Link's Awakening that builds on that game’s beautiful aesthetic while introducing just enough new mechanics to feel truly distinct. The dubious performance and repetitive combat can drag, but this is largely an excellent adventure throughout.",0.8,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has a lot of merit and begs to be played, especially by fans who have been clamouring for something new in the series. It's also a proof of concept, courtesy of a new studio, showing that Nintendo intends to explore new avenues of gameplay, which in the future may result in iterations that further separate Link and Zelda as playable characters. Maybe with another character who shall not be named, you know, to complete the Triforce.",0.8,6
"How Princess Zelda repairs mysterious rifts across Hyrule is what makes Echoes of Wisdom special. With a magic wand, she can make an echo, or copy, of nearly everything — clay pot, quilted bed or sword-swinging Moblin.",0.8,6
"After many years of living in the shadow of the brave Link, Zelda has finally been given a protagonist role in her own game. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a colorful and charming spin-off that may, however, offer too little to appeal to fans of Breath of the Wild.",0.8,6
"Zelda takes the lead in the adventure and uses all the creative tools at her disposal to explore, fight and solve puzzles.",0.8,6
"None of these criticisms should dissuade potential buyers, for Echoes is filled with the usual Zelda-series charm, humour and adventure, while the copy-and-paste mechanic introduces some smart and mischievous puzzles.",0.8,6
"The Zelda license returns magically to Nintendo Switch with a title that brings a welcomed breath of fresh air. Giving us the unprecedented opportunity to embody the Princess herself, Echoes of Wisdom carries the legacy of an entire license to which it brings its load of (small) new additions. Grezzo has succeeded in combining the feeling of dungeon exploration that many fans have been missing, with gameplay directly inspired by Tears of the Kingdom. In this way, the game manages to appeal to fans both past and present, for an experience which proves that even after almost 40 years, Nintendo's historic IPs know how to renew themselves and, above all, don't hesitate to dare. After such an opus, we can only ask for even more ambition for future 2D Zelda games. ",0.8,6
"Echoes of Wisdom is a solid game with fantastic ideas that will force you to reprogram that Legend of Zelda brain you've been shaping over years and years of practice. Grezzo has created an experience worth trying and a journey no fan of the franchise will regret starting. That being said, we can't ignore the fact that there are several elements in the game's design that fall short because they don't reach the level of maturity we see in era-defining games.",0.8,6
"Playful and with a spatial openness previously unknown in the isometric Hyrule, Zelda celebrates her grand entrance, but also proves that the Switch is technically at the end of the line even when it comes to in-house productions. ... The approach of omitting iconic tools works because the heroine is able to shake a bouquet of alternatives from her staff in return - and thus builds up more than a sword could ever tear down.",0.8,6
"Who is this Zelda Echoes of Wisdom really for? This is the perfectly legitimate question that one can ask oneself after finishing the adventure, not without some desire to give up along the way. By wanting to play the break with the remake of A Link's Awakening and avoid taxing this episode as a simple DLC with a playable Zelda, Nintendo has opted for a gameplay that is the opposite of what a Zelda game represents for many people. No real combat here, but instead room for reflection and puzzle solving, that's the heart of the gameplay and we can obviously understand that the game risks displeasing a large part of the usual audience.",0.8,6
"After cooking up extremely original ideas with the latest 3D entries in the series, it is great to see Nintendo apply this lust for originality to top-down Legend of Zelda, too. There isn't a lot to be said for difficulty, and, like Tears of the Kingdom before it, certain gameplay features can be abused to make the quest easier, but the key thing about Echoes of Wisdom is that it is so much fun to play. The 3D games got their much-needed shake-up, and now the top-down format has received it for the better, as well. It was far too long of a wait for Princess Zelda to get her playable role in the series that bears her name, but this is an excellent start to hopefully bigger things to come.",0.8,6
"This wonderfully engaging adventure combines the best features from classic Zelda games with several new mechanics from more recent entries. Developer Grezzo doesn't nail every aspect of the experience, but the neverending stream of fun puzzles and charming gameplay easily outshine the game's weaker points.",0.8,6
"Echoes of Wisdom’s best parts are the ones that break away from what’s expected. My favorite moments largely happen in Still World rifts, where I need to carve my own path through twisted snippets of Hyrule’s world using echoes. I’m attuned with Zelda most when I find a large gap I can’t pass, but realize I can get to the other side by grabbing hold of a flying tile with my bind ability and following its path. In clever puzzle platform moments like that, I feel like I'm tapping into her third of the Triforce; I’m using her wisdom to meet any challenge that arises. And I’m doing that by drawing on her connection to all things within her kingdom and communicating her eternal royalty through tangible play.",0.7,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom follows a different approach than you are used to from the series. Instead of an action/adventure game, you play a puzzle adventure. This generally works out well. The gameplay is fun, with a fairly large world in which there is a lot to do. The puzzles are interesting and sometimes quite challenging in the dungeons. What does not work so well is choosing the Echoes. At a certain point you get so many that choosing takes a lot of time, which interrupts the action for too long. The optional rifts also become a bit monotonous quite quickly. The biggest thorn in the side is the performance, with a frequently changing frame rate and resolution, which makes the game not play well. That affects the experience. If the technical side is or is being addressed, you can add a whole point to the final score.",0.7,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has a lot going for it. There is a lot to do and discover without being overwhelming. The visuals are vibrant and fun, and the characters are cute. Although the controls can be annoying at times, it is satisfying when you finally get past an obstacle. It will be interesting to see where Nintendo takes us for the next Zelda installment in the future.",0.7,6
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom puts a new spin on the series’ formula but never quite finds itself. I like coming up with creative ways to use as bed as much as the next person, but I’d prefer if the challenges were more consistently creative in return. Instead, things just bled together until I could have just played on autopilot. It takes more than a dress and a bed to keep things interesting.",0.65,6
"Despite some ambitious ideas, beneath the surface Echoes of Wisdom is surprisingly uneven Zelda adventure. Few of its headline mechanics are utilised to their potential which means that, while enjoyable and charming, it ultimately feels less essential than other modern 2D entries.",0.6,6
"It’s great to finally get to play as Zelda, but working out how to take an active without being able to fight is rather hard work.",0.6,6
"It’s a fun as hell game. It’s challenging and satisfying. And it fits neatly in the established mythos as another incarnation of our beloved hero(es). There’s a real sense of accomplishment in conducting a herd of boomerang-wielding Bokoblins as they pepper every enemy with attacks and then conjuring a bridge made of beds to cross an unjumpable gap. Sure, you might not be swinging the sword, but Echoes of Wisdom proves that the pen — or the bed, table, crate, or boulder — can be even mightier.",-0.01,6
"After 35 years of lending her name to the iconic franchise, I wanted Zelda’s first game to be a little bit more worthy of her intelligence and her strength.",-0.01,6
"Echoes of Wisdom successfully combines the feel of earlier Zelda games with the new creative direction that the modern entries have been going in. By fusing the classic key item progression of older Zelda games with the more modern, player-driven problem-solving of Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild, Echoes of Wisdom creates something both familiar, yet distinct from every other game in the series so far. Also, our long-suffering Hyrulian princess finally gets some time in the spotlight, and that is a welcome change of pace.",-0.01,6
"Reynatis offers an interesting story and bloody fights with a dual system between defense and attack that is really engaging, especially in the boss fights with gigantic monsters. Unfortunately, exploring Tokyo and the parallel world Another is not as engaging, since apart from rare situations it turns out to be little more than a walking simulator. Technically it is not excellent, with models and textures that recall what we saw on PS3, but at least there are no slowdowns or dropped frames. If you are looking for a story full of charismatic characters, it could be for you.",0.75,5
Reynatis will seduce you if you're open to forgive a few mistakes (and have a good English skill).,0.7,5
"Reynatis breaks the cardinal rule of not reminding players about better games. Everything from the concept to the gameplay feels like a less engaging version of The World Ends with You, and the fact there's an in-game crossover between the two makes it not feel like a coincidence. There's very little that makes Reynatis stand out, and there are quite a few baffling game design choices. I can see players gleaning some fun from it, but only if they've already experienced its better inspirations.",0.65,5
"Reynatis is close to a master at one trade, with its unique and refreshing combat system. But there’s too many other pieces that drag the overall presentation down, especially with its outdated graphics, poor Switch performance, awkward camera angles, and high price tag. However, even through all its minor to glaring flaws, and believe me there are many, it's an adventure I find myself looking fondly back on the things it does well.",0.65,5
"Reynatis is obviously made by a small team with a lot of passion for the world and concept, but the game’s disparate ideas simply don’t come together into a truly cohesive package. There’s greatness hidden in Reynatis and even bits that I truly loved, like the text conversations, but it all comes with some caveats. I don’t regret the time I spent with Reynatis, and think there could be the spark of something truly interesting if it gets a sequel. But for now, it feels a bit like RPG junk food, satisfying in some ways, but leaving you wanting more.",0.6,5
"Reynatis is a game full of heart that reminds me of the golden age of PS2 RPG adventures, for better and for worse. It's full of interesting ideas, but is lacking consistent execution. If you can see past that, I do think that the charm of the game – the strong character writing, the living city of Shibuya, and angsty JRPG vibe of it all – will really resonate.",0.6,5
"Those that have seen the secret ending for Kingdom Hearts 3 know that Kingdom Hearts 4 could very well be series director Tetsuya Nomura's attempt at making his vision of Versus 13 made real, but I'm so glad that we have Reynatis as another interpretation of that vision, and to be honest, I hope even more developers make their own interpretations of Versus 13. Reynatis is a reality based on fantasy, and though it's far from perfect, that's enough for me.",0.6,5
"Far from being the disaster prophesied by the genre's detractors, but the miracle desired by fans of the great artists involved this time by FuRyu, REYNATIS is a practical demonstration of how, many times, it is not enough to put together brilliant minds to give life to an authentic masterpiece. Indeed, the superficial screenplay by Kazushige Nojima and the repetitive soundtrack composed by Yoko Shimomura almost seem to suggest that not even they fully believed in the goodness of the project, whose most successful elements are hands down the artwork created by Yasutaka Kaburagi. Although limited by an extremely dated technical sector and an almost non-existent level of difficulty, the combat system of REYNATIS is quite intriguing, even if some mechanics could have been implemented with greater conviction. All things considered, REYNATIS takes home a passing grade, however the advice is to wait for the first discount before pouring into the streets of this dystopian reinterpretation of Shibuya.",0.6,5
"A disappointing outcome, especially considering the prestigious names involved in its creation, like Yoko Shimomura and Kazushige Nojima. Despite their contributions, the game fails to live up to its potential, with lackluster storytelling, underdeveloped characters, and repetitive combat mechanics. While the Tokyo-based setting and the political undertones initially seem intriguing, they quickly devolve into shallow execution. The game's graphics, combat system, and soundtrack also suffer from mediocrity. Overall, Reynatis appears to be another missed opportunity from Furyu Corporation, relying on big names but delivering an ultimately forgettable experience.",0.55,5
The story and world-building are definitely the most interesting things about Reynatis but it’s a shame everything else feels so half-baked and repetitive. It’s hard to get invested in the characters when the dull combat makes you want to get through the adventure as quickly as possible.,0.5,5
"Reynatis, the latest action RPG from FuRyu, combines intriguing world-building and fluid combat but falters in storytelling and gameplay depth. Despite contributions from Yoko Shimomura and Kazushige Nojima, the rushed narrative leaves the experience feeling incomplete. The combat mechanics are engaging but lack challenge, while repetitive dungeons and lackluster side quests drag down the pacing. With some polish and deeper storytelling, Reynatis could have been something special, but as it stands, it’s a fun yet flawed journey.",0.5,5
Quotation forthcoming.,0.5,5
"Reynatis isn't an awful game to play, but it remains a pretty average experience throughout.",0.5,5
"We played Reynatis so you don't have to. Sometimes too much ambition can lead to a wide gap between on-paper ideas and the actual creation and production processes, and this is very well the case. A convoluted story, a lot of technical issues and boring and repetitive gameplay don't do justice to the great soundtrack. ",0.48,5
"I'm not sure what happened with Reynatis. Yoko Shimomura and Kazushige Nojima are legends. It feels like FuRyu had everything they needed to deliver a great JRPG. However, game development is difficult, and some projects are bound to miss the mark. That happened here in a big way. Reynatis is one of the most miserable experiences I have had with a game in decades. It is an ugly, repetitive mess that houses some of the worst writing the medium has to offer. Outside of the OST, there is almost nothing of value here. If this is, in fact, anything like what Final Fantasy Versus 13 was supposed to be, then I can comfortably say that Final Fantasy fans dodged a bullet.",0.2,5
"FC 25 is the first genuinely good FC game in years. A complete tactical overhaul underpins the game’s quality, with sweeping and much-needed changes to Career Mode backing it up, unfortunately, somewhat at the expense of Clubs and Ultimate Team.",0.8,4
"Succeeding where last year's edition fell short, EA Sports FC 25 debuts without loud changes, but with a substantial number of updates that touch almost all of its countless game modes. The improvements made to Career Mode and Clubs were essential, while we were slightly disappointed with Rush and the overall lack of significant changes to Ultimate Team. However, what makes the game bright — and perhaps the most crucial aspect of a football game — is the slow, balanced gameplay with astonishing tactical depth that the Canadian studio managed to deliver this year.",0.8,4
"On the whole, I like the changes to this year's game; FC IQ and the player roles fit into the game well - with the exception of a few lapses - and it simply feels good in your hands. I also really like the new Rush mode, much better than the overly cool Volta, which never really kept me hooked for more than few minutes.",0.8,4
"EA Sports FC 25 builds on the great technological innovations of last year's edition and takes them a little further, making football more realistic and tactical. And you have much more and better control over it all. However, the game doesn't offer any major innovations to convince you that this is the edition you need to pick up.",0.8,4
"EA Sports FC 25 continues along the same path as its predecessor, but with a slightly faster and more decisive pace. The new focus on tactics could be the first step toward a more ambitious vision for the future of the series. Overall, this installment proves to be content-rich, relying on the usual winning features while introducing a new 5v5 mode that adds just the right touch to enhance the overall package. ",0.79,4
"If FC 24 had shaken up some things a bit along with its name, starting with the gameplay, FC 25 has not taken this path at all. The considerable contribution this year is called Rush, a new way of playing 5 against 5 quite well integrated into all game modes alongside the classic 11-a-side football. Because even if the title integrates FC IQ, a new tactical and positioning system for AI players very interesting in Career and Clubs mode for budding managers, the gameplay hardly changes one iota compared to last season. Haters of the last opus may therefore move on, except for lovers of Kings League and Ligue 1. The latter will be able to rejoice to see many players from the French championship modeled unlike last year. Cocorico!",0.75,4
"EA Sports FC 25 takes a useful step forward in simulating real football, with a new tactics system and smarter AI, but the improvements aren’t quite as effective as they could be.",0.7,4
"While FC IQ has elevated the on-pitch experience somewhat, off the pitch FC 25 hasn't really changed at al since last yearl. It's all a bit stagnant, in truth. If EA Sports FC 25 were a football stadium, it'd be Old Trafford - a once majestic beast that’s now in need of some serious work.",0.7,4
"EA FC 25 still plays a fine game of football in all of its online and offline modes, but it's fairly hard to get excited about any of it this year. The new depth to tactics, and ability to switch them up on-the-fly, are welcome additions. However, Rush feels a bit flat and forced, whilst the rest of the modes on offer are overwhelmingly familiar. We can see what EA was going for, and it's worked in some respects, but the focus on Rush, and a lack of big changes elsewhere, make for a bit of an uninspired year in the land of football/soccer.",0.7,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is a better game than FC 24 was in many areas and metrics, where much has been improved, and the addition of Rush is absolutely a highlight. However, I can't turn a blind eye to the technical problems. The game has more bugs than I can remember, the menus feel very sluggish, and I've also seen people get completely black screens when they enter matches in certain game modes. These are things that ruin the gaming experience in what is otherwise a good football game.",0.7,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is the most complete football game in the series, but is it worth the €80 price tag? If you already own FC 24, you won’t miss much. For fans of Rush and Ultimate Team, it might be wise to wait for a price drop.",0.7,4
"Like many sports franchises that release yearly iterations, EA Sports FC 25 is going to be much like the game you remember from last year. While FC IQ and roles do a good job of making tactics feel varied and exciting, there are many adjustments and improvements that need to be made to AI before things feel balanced. When slide comes to tackle, not too much has changed this year.",0.6,4
"EA Sports FC 25 delivers a few bright spots, like the fun and refreshing Rush mode, but stagnating gameplay and incremental improvements leave it feeling like EA continues to play it too safe.",0.6,4
"The gameday experience remains fantastic and properly replicates the atmosphere, while the changes to AI greatly affect the gameplay. These two additions alone make EA SPORTS FC 25 stand out as one of the best in the series.",0.9,4
"It’s easy to dismiss EA Sports FC 25 as a glorified reskin of EA Sports FC 24 – and in many respects, it is – but the customarily small tweaks made to graphics and gameplay add up to a near-perfect sports game experience. This is total football.",0.9,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is an interesting (and more importantly, fun) new edition of the EA Sports football saga, with many small tweaks to the pre-existing game modes and two big new features, Rush and FC IQ. In both cases, it can be said that the target was hit, and that the overall quality stands at very good levels. A few bugs and glitches in the menus do not affect a more than enjoyable gaming ex-perience, which promises to keep fans busy for a long time with careers, multiplayer challenges and trading cards...",0.86,4
"In FC 25, FC IQ provides a welcome strategic overhaul for several FC modes, and Rush is apt to be a big hit for FC online community now with more social options. FC 25 is not a largest leap from FC 24, but definitely a step in the right direction for the franchise.",0.86,4
"EA Sports FC 25 brings the feeling of having more challenging and theoretically fair gameplay. And in the end, that’s what matters. The pursuit of realism is almost utopian – after all, we’re talking about a video game, not a live broadcast of a real match. So, of course, there need to be some more arcade-like elements and mechanics that make the game more fun.",0.86,4
"EA Sports FC 25 has been the game that has received the most serious development among the football games released in recent years. The depth that FC IQ adds to the game and the revolution made in tactical sense will give great pleasure especially for those who like to read the game from the sidelines. However, it should not be forgotten that this is ultimately an EA Sports football game, if it can maintain the same pleasure after a patch or two, EA FC 25 can successfully write its name in the history of football games.",0.85,4
EA Sports FC 25 is one of the better successor of the recent EA Sports FC-history. Rush is a pure joy to play and fits the series well. FC IQ delivers more depth and – despite some balancing-issues – impacts the match-flow significantly.,0.85,4
"EA Sports FC 25 marks a turning point for the better in the renewed football franchise. Of course, it carries some vices from the past, but it is far from those disastrous moments or those that showed a lack of interest among followers of this type of games. We can say that the foundation is being built for a total football experience that satisfies casual and demanding players and that is saying a lot, as it breaks with the mediocre period of recent years. We are sure that this year's installment will have more fun for you and that you will scream with emotion for each goal as if it were real, so, believe it or not, there are more good ones than bad ones this year. Happy start to the football season.",0.85,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is an exceptional soccer simulator, a more realistic and fun experience than in previous years, with welcome adjustments to the on-field action and enhancing the sport's tactical approach like never before. FC 25 is a must-have for fans of the British sport.",0.85,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is the game we hoped for last year. With a slight delay, the Vancouver team has partially restructured the franchise, giving it a refreshed spirit. While it’s still rooted in the classic FIFA formula, the revamped modes add depth and deliver the best single-player experience in years without sacrificing multiplayer or the importance of Ultimate Team. The new HyperMotionV physics and FC IQ tactical engines provide a solid new foundation for the series, enhancing both strategy and visuals. Player models have improved, Rush is a delight, and the overall experience is now more fun, varied, and visually appealing than ever.",0.85,4
"EA SPORTS FC 25 introduces a tactical layer that alters how you play on the pitch. Combined with new PlayStyles, and improved HyperMotion, the game is an authentic representation of the sport. Although there are only small tweaks to systems, each thoughtful change improves your time under the floodlights. Rush injects new life into the multiplayer portion with its fast-paced, 5-a-side matches. While Career Mode still requires more attention, the new features are a step in the right direction. Although FC 25 doesn’t completely reinvent the formula, it successfully refines the gameplay experience, delivering a more immersive, strategic, and enjoyable football simulation that fans of the series will appreciate.",0.84,4
"It's a mixed experience, with moments of enhanced fun thanks to new gameplay features, but also frustrating issues in regards to goalkeeper and tackle behavior. While Rush is a welcome addition, other areas like slow menus, moderate updates to game modes, and weaker tactical options compared to its predecessor fall short. The game shines in terms of visuals and technical performance, running smoothly on PS5, delivering impressive graphics.",0.84,4
"EA Sports FC 25 confirms the solidity of Electronic Arts' modern gaming and content proposal, in a chapter that is starting to show signs of a long-desired revolution. The main game modes do not offer any particular innovations, but are still more integrated with each other thanks to a unified progression system and Rush, which acts as a minimum common denominator integrating equally between Career, Ultimate Team and Club. Volta's replacement is in fact more effective and focused than its predecessor, although in cooperative matches it turns out to be quite confusing and frenetic. In any case, the substantial difference this year is in the gameplay, which maximizes the technological achievements obtained thanks to HypermotionV, FC IQ and Cranium for a more realistic, immersive and engaging digital football experience than ever before: finally, thanks above all to the improvement of Team Tactics and Player Roles, FC 25 embraces a more strategic idea of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;football and less focused on full-throttle speed. Another small and significant step forward towards the definitive leap in quality.",0.82,4
"EA Sports FC 25 offers a very complete experience that comes from presenting an overwhelming amount of content, accompanied by several improvements in different modes, although I think there is still a lot of room for improvement. Essentially, it is a very good game that is limited by a recurring problem: the weight of microtransactions in Ultimate Team.",0.81,4
"EA FC 25 is definitely a game of two halves. Its core is still excellent and endlessly enjoyable, and several new additions have given fresh life to the game. However, it remains held back by age-old issues that have plagued the series year-on-year. Overall it offers an improvement over the previous iteration, and Rush, in particular, is an outstanding addition that I hope will become a core part of the game in years to come, but I just wish that painfully slow menus, an abundance of bugs, and sometimes sluggish gameplay wouldn't hold it back.",0.8,4
"You don’t change a winning team, and that’s almost exactly what EA Sports FC 25 is offering this season. The basis of the precedent is there, with changes that are more like adjustments than profound upheavals. The fun is there, the life of the title always as consistent and finally there is enough new material in each mode to invite you to experience. The big plus is the Rush mode, clearly, and we’ll have to see how EA Sports plans to exploit a well-promoted mode everywhere in the coming months to gauge its potential accurately. In the meantime, deep in love or not in love with the ball, you know what to do in a few days with your money. One more season. ",0.8,4
"It's like a new paint job for a car you've been driving for years, it shines and smells fresh, but it's a highly familiar experience. However, Rush and FC IQ are novelties that deserve high praise in this mission to please Greeks and Trojans.",0.8,4
"EA Sports FC 25 establishes itself as a new evolution in the series. There's nothing revolutionary within the game, but it does add enough incentive to be engaging, despite being ‘same old, same old’. FC IQ has impact, Rush mode is fun and the presentation remains impeccable.",0.8,4
"The criteria for evaluating whether or not you should purchase it depends on your love for the saga, since, if you are looking for the latest news, it is a must-buy that will bring with it hundreds of hours of fun, but if your profile is not that Dude, could you wait a little longer.",0.8,4
"Thanks to a couple of key improvements and changes, EA Spots FC 25 is one of the better iterations that EA Sports' annual football franchise has seen in recent years.",0.8,4
"EA FC 25 might not be the giant leap forward that many fans were hoping for, but its best-in-class visuals and realistic matches still comfortably make it the best football sim on the market. While it’s disappointing that some of its biggest and best additions haven’t been fully capitalized on, it still sets a strong foundation for EA SPORTS to build on in the coming years.",0.8,4
"This is an honest entry into football gaming, the kind you can buy this year and enjoy for two, or three seasons, or however long it takes for EA Sports to add new features worth checking out. Career Mode remains a far cry from Football Manager, and the licensing situation might as well have changed the series name to ""European Football 25"". Odds are it will not get better for a while. FC 25 is like watching football: a mix of great moments, frustration, and occasionally asking yourself ""Why did I put two hours into this"". The answer is that FC 25, like football, is just good fun.",0.8,4
"FC 25's gameplay familiarity may trigger initial disappointment, but career mode tweaks and the brilliant Rush mode soon pull you back in for another year. Ultimate Team, meanwhile, remains divisive as ever – but fans of that mode will love its myriad fan-service additions.",0.8,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is perhaps not the major structural leap forward that its predecessor was – it is, to use the classic phrase, an evolution not a revolution. To get the most out of its major new technical features, you’ll need to really dig down into the depths of the pre-match menu systems – and that’s not for everybody. Meanwhile, Ultimate Teams is as problematic as ever with its carefully greased compulsion loop of in-game purchases and micro-improvements to your fantasy squad.",0.8,4
"The cash cow of Ultimate Team will always override everything else with FC 25, sadly. In an ideal world, EA Sports would develop Clubs into a major eSport, which would do extremely well. Real world soccer clubs around the world could have their own teams, and most importantly, the gameplay would then take priority with Ultimate Team being in the background generating income. Plainly, the game would be much better for it.",0.8,4
"This year's edition solidifies its claim as the best football game around, but it also showcases a need for competition, so there is pressure to iron out some of the frustrating kinks.",0.8,4
"Thanks to the introduction of FC IQ, the on-pitch action in EA Sports FC 25 is more dynamic and authentic than ever before. And while most other changes are small, the replacement of Volta with Rush, a 5v5 match type that is accessible in most game modes, makes this a worthy upgrade from last year's release overall.",0.8,4
"FC25 is an improvement on the previous entry, moving in a positive direction. Ultimate Team continues to be egregious, but Rush is refreshing and fun. Refocusing its gameplay to a more deliberate and slower paced brand of football, that takes tactics into account, makes for a more enjoyable game. With some minor updates, its potential can be fulfilled. FC25 has found its form, and is the best an EA footie title has been in years.",0.8,4
"EA Sports FC 25 makes smart choices so that the time you're spending in the game feels much more worthwhile. Rush is the best addition in years, and hopefully indicative of the future of the franchise. ",0.8,4
"EA Sports FC 25 has a focus on tactics that are mostly noticeable, and while Rush is a cool new mode, it does feel pretty similar to last year.",0.8,4
"EA FC 25 doesn't live up to its launch price. The game has limited improvements, especially in terms of gameplay, which make it only worth it for those who play competitive mode, or for those who can't live without Ultimate Team.",0.8,4
EA SPORTS FC 25 builds up the future of the franchise with a revolution on the tactic side and a great new experience like Rush.,0.8,4
"More realistic gameplay, more tactical depth and the rush mode are welcome, but in no way justify the price tag.",0.76,4
"If FC 24 had shaken up some things a bit along with its name, starting with the gameplay, FC 25 has not taken this path at all.

"EA Sports FC 25 looks, feels, and plays like a truly upgraded version of the franchise. It isn’t a perfect sports simulator, but it does a great job of making the game feel alive and takes another step forward for the franchise.",0.75,4
"FC 25 is an enjoyable, yet unexciting entry with welcome additions such Rush and big updates to Manager Career. Those expecting notable changes anywhere else will be left disappointed, though there’s more than enough here to keep the annual title kicking along.",0.75,4
"EA Sports FC 25 follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, adding a number of welcome details such as the arrival of women in the career mode and the rush mode, not forgetting the roles that add an ever more tactical edge to your matches. However, the experience is spoiled in part by the many problems that remain, which can clearly discourage many. In the end, we wouldn't recommend the version as it stands, given that it's more of an update to FC 24 than a new game in its own right. Prefer a console version if you really want to buy it.",0.75,4
"Playing EA Sports FC 25 provided lots of fun. The new things are cool, the online matches go on without problems, and crossplay guarantees rivalry between people with different platforms. But I can't look past all the technical issues - if not for them, the final grade would be higher.",0.75,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is especially fun for players who like to tactically control the game thanks to a series of new options. In addition, the game has an enormously wide range with the introduction of a simulation mode and Rush. FC 25 still has some rough edges that prevent us from dealing with a championship-worthy selection.",0.75,4
"EA Sports FC 25 has cut the amount of innovations to the bone compared to last year, although the scope of some of them is bound to make a lasting impression on hardcore soccer aficionados. FC IQ might be the strongest new feature in years, but it's also so easy to miss it that people will probably dub it yet another more of the same - and understandably so, given the shortage of surface-level additions.",0.7,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is an excellent improvement over its predecessor in many areas. Rush mode – especially when played with friends – is brilliant at times and brings back the fun of EA’s football game. However, the game has too many issues to truly impress us. The gameplay and FC IQ are well-designed, but the servers are often so poor that everything feels sluggish. Both the menus and the online gameplay feel very slow, although that still doesn't stop us from enjoying FC 25 quite a bit.",0.7,4
"The two main innovations in FC 25, namely Rush mode and the FC IQ system, really hit the mark. However, the other significant changes can be counted on the fingers of one hand. If you liked FC 24, you will certainly like FC 25, but if you were not a fan of the previous installment, you will probably not have a good time here.",0.7,4
"EA FC 25 offers a much more polished gameplay and adds enough details to make the experience at the controls much better. In addition, the new career mode is now more interesting and deeper for those of us who enjoy creating our own legacy.",0.7,4
"EA Sports FC 25 is a slightly better offering than FC 24, thanks to the new Rush mode. FC IQ is still in its early stages and while it could have a huge impact on future titles, it is not yet very apparent how it is impacting the on the pitch action in this game. This is the EA Sports FC as you already know it. Whether that is a good or bad thing is up to you.",0.7,4
"EA FC 25 shines for its tactical realism and Career Coach mode, but stumbles over an ageing interface and on-field gameplay that struggles to convince unless you switch to simulator mode.",0.7,4
"EA FC 25 is a fickle title. For every two steps forward, EA takes one step back and one step sideways. Although it's still an improvement on last year's release, it's not a significant enough evolution to dispel the idea that it's the same game every year. That's what you get when you play to manage the score.",0.7,4
"Same procedure as every year... a few optimizations here and there, but unfortunately also noticeable improvements that make things worse. If you don't need UT, you can stick with EA FC 24.",0.7,4

"EA is playing a better game than last year. That’s not to say that EA Sports FC 25 is suddenly a classic footie or anything – far from it; this is no Fifa 17, let alone PES 5 or Sensible Soccer. But hey, the bar is just not set very high in 2024.",0.65,4
"It is a bit difficult to rate this game. Mechanically, this is a good game. The football fits like a shot, but if you bought last year's edition, I'm not quite sure if I can in good conscience recommend you buy this...EA Sports FC 25 is the best soccer game on the market, but primarily because there are no real alternatives.",0.6,4
"If FC 24 had shaken up some things a bit along with its name, starting with the gameplay, FC 25 has not taken this path at all. The considerable contribution this year is called Rush, a new way of playing 5 against 5 quite well integrated into all game modes alongside the classic 11-a-side football. Because even if the title integrates FC IQ, a new tactical and positioning system for AI players very interesting in Career and Clubs mode for budding managers, the gameplay hardly changes one iota compared to last season. Haters of the last opus may therefore move on, except for lovers of Kings League and Ligue 1. The latter will be able to rejoice to see many players from the French championship modeled unlike last year. Cocorico!",0.75,4
"EA FC 25 feels like possession soccer devoid of ideas - lots of control, but too little real innovation.",0.74,4
"EA Sports FC 25 continues to hand in the same homework it's done for the past few years now, albeit with a new paragraph on Rush. It's a solid game that will likely enjoy plenty of additions throughout the year, but I'd like to see more ambition in the future.",0.7,4
"There's a lot to like about EA FC 25, from the overhauled tactics to the chaotic addition of Rush and a few welcome improvements to Career mode. It's not a resounding victory, however. The on-field action has stagnated, maintaining its quality but also plenty of its flaws, while changes to Ultimate Team feel antagonistic in their design. In the near future, issues like input lag and its propensity to crash will hopefully be fixed, but the same is unlikely to be true for its long-standing problems. At the end of the day--to borrow common football player lingo--there's fun to be had with EA FC 25, especially if you enjoyed last year's game, but rather than taking a significant leap forward, it's content to settle for midtable form.",0.6,4
"It’s a bit like Serie A in that way then, is FC25. And while I remain privately furious that the move away from the FIFA licence seems to have left EA without the adequate rights for some of Serie A’s best teams (honestly, you should see the ‘We have AC Milan at home’ travesties in place of the licensed teams), I am pleased to say I’ve had more raw, honest enjoyment with FC25 than I have any of its recent predecessors. Partly because it feels like the PC port got the required amount of love this year, and partly because I feel just slightly more empowered to play a different style of football this year. In my heart of hearts, I know that this inch-by-inch progress doesn’t justify £50 on a ‘new’ game every year. But here I am, playing it anyway and enjoying it like a comfy old favourite jumper that’s just had the elbows repaired.",-0.01,4
"Disney Epic Mickey Rebrushed is a necessary and competent remake that respects the original, making what was already good even better. Its mature story speaks well to older players and opens up a new world for younger players by taking us on a journey through Disney's past.

"Epic Mickey is a stunning-looking game packed with memorable locations, a cast of unforgettable characters, and solid meat-and-potatoes gameplay. The paintbrush mechanic is satisfying and feels right at home in the Wasteland without every coming across as too gimmicky. There's a few annoying hiccups here and there, but overall, Epic Mickey is an adventure worth your time.",0.9,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed brings back the beloved Wii classic, and does it spectacularly. In addition to having the basics, such as improved graphics, the remake adds new features to the original adventure, such as improved control and new moves for the main character. It is sure to become a real gem for fans of the animation studio.",0.9,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a delight to play. Purple Lamp did a fantastic job of remaking the game from scratch with grand visuals and the addition of a double jump makes the game more playable than its Wii incarnation. The paint and thinner mechanics are a true highlight of this Disney adventure, and the overall atmosphere of the game is both creepy and upbeat. It would be a real treat to see if Purple Lamp could make an Epic Mickey 3 in the future, as this game shows the Vienna-studio's talent of making the Wasteland come to life.",0.9,3
"Disney Epic MIckey: Rebrushed is a joy to revisit or play for the first time in 2024. The few design flaws that do present aren't nearly impactful enough to bring down the whole experience. Epic Mickey remains one of Disney's strongest showing in the medium of games, and Rebrushed is a nostalgic and heartwarming reminder why. ",0.85,3
"A remaster of Epic Mickey didn’t need much to be a slam dunk, other than to save this inventive and introspective piece of Disney history from finding itself in the same state as the ‘toons it spotlights – unworthy of the current corporate image and left to decay in the dark. As a bonus though, Purple Lamp’s capable brushstrokes have managed to both preserve the art and make it easier than ever to appreciate.",0.85,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed corrects all the flaws of the original to provide a much more polished and enjoyable experience with the most famous mouse of all. Despite its simple appearance, it has much to offer, making it a highly recommended title, especially if you enjoy platforming games.",0.85,3
"Epic Mickey is a remake that fixes the problems of the original games. If you like platformer games or Disney characters, you'll definitely enjoy it. If you like both, this will be a great treatment.",0.8,3
Developer Purple Lamp successfully brings the Wii original into the year 2024 with mostly fully new graphics that (more or less) make the remake look like a current production. The action adventure is too undemanding for a must-have. But with its creative gameplay and as an atmospheric Homage to Disney classics it's worth buying not simply for fans of the original.,0.8,3
"Originally a Wii exclusive, Epic Mickey Rebrushed has had an incredible face lift, making it feel every bit as fresh as a brand new game from 2024. This is a rich and worthwhile adventure-platformer even if you're not a huge Disney fan — but if you are, you'll get a huge kick out of the frequent nods to the company's long history.",0.8,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a wonderful remake that looks gorgeous in many different ways, with simple yet fun platforming at its core.",0.8,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed brings some important touches to a unique platformer that can now be played again under better conditions. It could have been better, but the remastering work is competent and reminds us of the great virtues that this Wii exclusive had.",0.8,3
"A lovely time capsule of a game, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is exactly the kind of nostalgia we need. A fresh lick of paint brings Mickey's adventure up to today's standard, with a simple approach to gameplay to draw in the young and old alike.",0.8,3
"There are some lovely 2D side-scrolling moments too, which helps to break up the gameplay. You can even replay your faves in a new option.",0.8,3
"Disney Epic Mickey Rebrushed is a pleasant surprise and just as much a love letter to Warren’s Spector game as that creation was to the Disney Universe itself. The ability to change the surrounding world and see the consequences of your actions still feels fresh and engaging. The new addition might not be groundbreaking, but they help leave behind the shackles of the Wii and turn the game into an experience without frustrations caused by certain limitations. And even better news is that in the future we might see a remake of the sequel, making the story whole.",0.8,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a heartfelt love letter to the early days of Disney and the delightfully weird shorts that built the house of Mouse brick by brick. More than that it’s the kind of lovingly crafted platformer, with a unique hook, a gorgeous world to explore, and new adventures around every corner. There’s a word to describe it, its just on the tip of my tongue – monumentous?",0.8,3
Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed remains a strange game but one that's compelling and rewarding. It's excellent that this Wii classic is this enjoyable all of these years after its initial release and it looks great this time around to boot.,0.79,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a renovation of the original game rather than just a fresh coat of paint. Of course, it's a remake that stays loyal to the plot, combat, and level design while making improvements to the graphics, controls, and camera—aspects of the game that were criticized on the 2010 version. It also has some intriguing changes that this cult game never had before.",0.78,3
"Disney Epic Mickey is back, this time as a multiplatform title. The game formula is still enjoyable thanks to the magic brush mechanic and the graphic facelift operated by Purple Lamp is appreciable, as are the improved camera system. Unfortunately, the longevity remains quite poor, also due to secondary activities that are not particularly stimulating.",0.78,3
Quotation forthcoming.,0.75,3
"Disney’s Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a wonderful remake that remains faithful to the original whilst adding new elements to improve the adventure. Mickey is now much more mobile and the revised controls remove frustrations that engulfed the Wii release. Though the game lacks challenge and includes rather basic combat, its stunning visual overhaul and new features give it a new lease of life, making it a worthwhile revisit for both newcomers and longtime fans.",0.75,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a fresh coat of paint for the twisted take on Disney’s forgotten edges, yet it falls short of being a masterpiece. As remakes go, the game breathes new life into the graphics, even adding extra gameplay moves and other quality-of-life improvements. However, a tedious objective system and a lack of voiced dialogue feels like a missed opportunity for Mickey’s return. Despite this, the title shines in its preservation of a unique chapter in Disney’s gaming legacy and offers hope that we might just see more from Mickey and Oswald yet.",0.75,3
"Disney’s Epic Mickey Rebrushed is full of new ideas and innovations and offers an interesting story in a dark fantasy world that is nothing like our perception of Disney’s world. The use of a paintbrush and other mechanics related to it in gameplay make Epic Mickey a very unique platformer experience, but issues such as inconsistent controls, bad camera, and repetitive missions eventually prevent it from becoming one of the best in the genre.",0.75,3
"Epic Mickey is still an enjoyable platformer with impeccable artistic talent driving it. The repetitive combat and exploration remains, but the Rebrushed updates go some way to remedying those shortcomings.",0.7,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed remains a fun platformer, but it falls short compared to modern titles like Astro Bot or The Plucky Squire. While the game's originality shines through and fans of the original will enjoy it, its slow pacing, dated presentation, and occasionally frustrating controls hold it back. Despite these flaws, it offers plenty of nostalgic charm for longtime players.",0.7,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a welcome return to the world of the Wasteland. While not the most challenging game, it has that Disney charm from start to finish.",0.7,3
"I’m not sure that anything can ever capture the lightning in a bottle that was Epic Mickey’s original concept, but Rebrushed is the closest thing we’ll ever get to that dark magic, even if one of its core pillars is something that still drags it down. If you’re a diehard fan, you’ll love all of the small changes Rebrushed makes to cut down on the grind and monotony the original suffered from, and if you’re a newcomer you’ll experience Disney’s weirdest venture at its absolute best.",0.7,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is exactly what you’d want from a remastered Wii game. It gives the visuals the contemporary sheen worthy of its unique art style, adds important control improvements to make it palatable to modern audiences, and also knows when to let the gameplay speak for itself. ",0.7,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a frustratingly faithful remake of a game that was already pretty decent. It looks great, and the quality of life additions make it much more enjoyable, but if you didn’t click with the original, there’s not much here that will change your mind.",0.7,3
Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a great idea held back by the era of games in which it was created. Younger players and fanatics of classic Disney may have a blast seeing this creative spin on the source material. But there’s little else that it does to stand out among the genre’s best.,0.7,3
"If you fancy a slightly old-school 3D platformer, Disney Epic Mickey is not a bad choice. Especially if you associate Disney with happy childhood memories, because the game, like the forgotten Disney characters in Wasteland, deserves a new turn in the spotlight and Purple Lamp and THQ Nordic make sure it gets it with this excellent remaster.",0.7,3
"You can tell that there was care and love put into this, and I’m rather thankful that something like this exists at all. Epic Mickey: Rebrushed does enough to justify being a worthy remake of a somewhat beloved game, though it’s not everyone’s cup of tea. It’s a solid platformer in its own right, and the new additions are welcome ones.",0.7,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed successfully improves upon the flawed original in some key ways, thus allowing its strengths to shine much brighter, but significant lingering issues in other areas hold it back from greatness.",0.7,3
"The changes have certainly made Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed a more fluid experience. It doesn't bring a lot of challenge but the new visuals have given plenty of life to the environments, even if they're mostly grim and dark. The control changes feel natural. The backtracking in the middle can slightly dampen the pace but, on the whole, I found the experience to be straight-forward. The presentation shines as a wander through some of Disney's vintage heyday but behind the nostalgia is a competent platformer.",0.7,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a worthwhile play if you are a fan of Disney, particularly the Disney Parks, as there are plenty of visual nods that are a joy to see. After all, which of us wouldn’t want to platform up Space Mountain, or restore a dilapidated It’s a Small World? But for the casual platforming fan, you won’t find much here that you’ve likely not experienced before. Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is an improvement upon its predecessor, adding depth and nicely updating the controls, and with that, returning fans will find what is, overall, a satisfying experience. The problem is, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is also stuck in the past with its lack of innovation and in today’s market, it’s hard to overlook that.",0.6,3
"If you gave someone who absolutely despises 3D platformers to make one, you’d probably get something like Epic Mickey Rebrushed. Even though this Remaster looks nicer than the original, it only managed to remind us how disappointing the original game was. As much as we love Mickey Mouse and 3D platformers, maybe it’s time to use the paint thinner on this one.",0.6,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a sandbox collect-a-thon that pays homage to the earliest eras of Disney creations. This no risk/no reward game looks good from the opening, but just seems like an animated feature that went on for 12 hours too long. With too much chatter, not enough fun, and literal pocket thinner, Epic is not the word I would paint here. ",0.55,3
"Disney Epic Mickey Rebrushed is set to be a definitive edition for fans and newcomers alike. With its stunning visuals, improved controls, and the timeless charm of the original, Rebrushed is a delightful adventure for Disney and platforming enthusiasts. The playtime of Rebrushed remains similar to the original, offering roughly 15 hours for the main story and an additional 10 hours for completionists seeking every collectible. If you didn't get the chance to play the original, then Rebrushed is well worth your time. And even if you did play the Wii version, then Disney Epic Mickey Rebrushed is the perfect opportunity to head back into the Wasteland and get your artistic side flowing.",0.86,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is an impressive remake of an already marvelous game. It features the story depth that is unusual for Disney, going beyond the confines of cartoonish fairy tales, while also paying the tribute to the company's classics. This is a mix that certainly deserves your attention.",0.85,3
"Armed with a magical paintbrush that can paint or thin out obstacles to uncover the path forward, Purple Lamb has given players a colorful and delightful remake that is faithful to its original release. Truly delivering Mickey’s best and most epic adventure finally for last and next-gen consoles and PC.",0.85,3
"Honestly, it’s kind of a relief that Epic Mickey: Rebrushed turned out so well. It’s not uncommon to have fond memories of an older game that turned out to wildly inaccurate in terms of remembering how good that older game actually was, so playing a remake like this, that shows Epic Mickey was just as fun as I remember it (even if it has an obvious new coat of paint), brings some a welcome feeling. Will Epic Mickey: Rebrushed garner the same kind of cult following that the Wii game got? Probably not – but hopefully that’s because being on more platforms allows more people to play this delightful game.",0.85,3
Quotation forthcoming.,0.81,3
"We welcome the return of the most famous mouse in the world with joy, albeit with a hint of bitterness: the game created by the now defunct Junction Point oozes originality from every brush stroke, and who knows, maybe one day Warren Spector and his colleagues will be able to give us a third chapter. The certainty remains that we are faced with one of the highest creative peaks reached in those years, and what better occasion than a graphic remake to rediscover its beauty?",0.8,3
"If you’re going to play Epic Mickey in 2024 – and you should – this is the definitive way to play the games. Clever tweaks here and there have significantly enhanced the original game, improving it across multiple aspects, without sacrificing the originality and uniqueness of its narrative. This is a chance to re-appreciate one of the best Wii exclusive games in a whole new format.",0.8,3
"I spent much more time with this remake than I would have thought beforehand! ... Like the original, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a damn likeable declaration of love to the Disney universe centered around the famous mouse.",0.8,3
"Mickey Rebrushed manages to revive a classic that, despite its flaws, still holds a special place in the hearts of many gamers. The remaster offers visual and gameplay improvements that make the Wasteland worth revisiting.",0.76,3
"Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a solid remaster that enhances the original experience with some nice improvements. Unfortunately, the experience is still carried by the setting exploring Disney's forgotten history, as the remaster does little to address dated level design, lackluster combat, and underdeveloped features like the morality system. Despite these shortcomings, Mickey's journey in the Wasteland remains enjoyable, especially for hardcore Disney fans eager to see some of the company’s long-forgotten characters brought back to life.",0.75,3
"Disney’s Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a solid revitalization of a work with grand ambitions, perhaps weighed down by the high expectations surrounding its creator. While it remains a good game, straddling the line between platformer and action-adventure, the overall quality feels somewhat inconsistent. The remaster smooths out some of the game’s more notorious rough edges and improves certain aspects of gameplay, but it can’t fully overturn the fate of a title that needed to do much more to leave a lasting impression.",0.75,3
"While a gorgeous remake with great quality of life features, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed still suffers by being itself. Outside of the aesthetic and choices, Epic Mickey was a fairly rote platformer with uninteresting challenges and objectives. Rebrushed adds a wonderful new coat of paint, but it’s still the same game at its core. ",0.75,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed updates a 2010 Wii classic for a new generation, somehow packing in even more nostalgia and twisted Disney references than ever before. An engaging story, gorgeous visuals, and bags of charm make it well worth the wait, despite some technical hitches and gameplay frustrations that detract from its undeniable potential.",0.7,3
"If you like Mickey Mouse and want to play a fun video game about him, you can do a lot worse than Epic Mickey: Rebrushed! You can also do a lot better, but that would require booting up some old emulators or expensive retro hardware, which is a different kind of thing from having something new(ish) on today’s platforms. Those decaying SNES carts in Mickeyjunk Mountain offer a good hint at what you should try next, though. I enjoyed it quite a bit, even if the way the story doesn't hold up in 2024 due to historical context made things kind of awkward.",0.7,3
"Epic Mickey Rebrushed is the ultimate version of the game and the team at Purple Lamp have clearly put a lot of love into updating the game for a contemporary audience. That being said, the additions to Mickey’s moveset are completely unnecessary and the core game remains largely the same. If you’ve played Epic Mickey before then this version will bring back any nostalgia you have for the game and if you haven’t then it is a good way to experience a neglected title. The lack of anything more than a cosmetic upgrade does make the high price a little hard to justify but this is still a solid game for anyone with a fondness for the Mouse. ",0.7,3
"Ultimately, Epic Mickey Rebrushed is a warm welcome, even if several aspects leave you wanting more improvements. This game deserves to be played by more people and beyond the confines of a multi-generation-old game system with an awful control scheme. Particularly with this game’s historical significance to a massive company like Disney, Epic Mickey Rebrushed does Mickey Mouse justice in a light that we rarely see the famous mouse. But, instead of being a modern classic, it just feels like a fun piece of Disney history.",0.7,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be a fun time for any 3D platformer and Disney fan, with all sorts of references to the past. It is a fascinating game that brings people deeper into the characters and worlds that Walt Disney created in his early days, and will be worth exploring Wasteland again for those that played the original Wii version thanks to the improvements made mechanically and visually. This is still a rather basic platformer that treads the line of tedium due to outdated fetch quests, and voice acting could have really benefitted the story scenes, but there is a great charm to this game, despite the darker tone, that will appeal to many.",0.7,3
A real clean sweep in a remaster that will only appeal to absolute fans or those who haven't played the original title.,0.7,3
"It retains the original charm, with graphical improvements and new mechanics, but could have made more use of the visual potential and challenged players more.",0.6,3
"Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed brings back the iconic 2010 Wii platformer with a fresh coat of paint. Though the nostalgia is undeniable, the gameplay mechanics and morality system feel outdated, leaving much to be desired. Its charming premise and art style may appeal to diehard fans, but performance issues on PC further dampen the experience.",0.55,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a throwback to a game that was a throwback when it came out, and it shows. While updated graphics put a nice coat of paint on things, and the story is far more intriguing than you’d expect from this sort of title, they don’t mask that underneath it, all the core mechanics and level design here don’t hold up. Fans of Mickey Mouse might put up with them to see one of the more interesting versions of the character in recent decades; everyone else should brush up on a better platformer.",0.5,3
"As someone who doesn't really get on with the source material, I find myself warmed by Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed. It's not all that challenging and sometimes a bit eh, but I liked that easygoing nature more than I resented it. You're free to splosh paint around and stumble into cool mechanical puzzles or simply remove the floor from an enemy and watch them plunge to their death. And while some of the side quests and optional tidbits don't amount to much more than, at most, an end credit sequence, I admire its adventurous spirit. You can tell it tries to do things a bit differently to the usual platformer and for the most part, it works.",-0.01,3
"Though I’ve always enjoyed Epic Mickey, I’m thrilled to have revisited the game, as it has held up remarkably well. This remake makes it better than ever. If you’re looking for that “Disney Magic,” so to speak, you’d be hard-pressed to find much better than this. Full of surprises, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a delight. ",0.9,3
"Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a welcome return for one of Mickey’s most memorable adventures, this is just about everything one could’ve wanted out of a revisit to a lost classic. It fumbles its execution a bit with the performance, but there are enough novel ideas and enjoyable gameplay concepts here to make the experience more than worth your while. Enjoyable gameplay, a captivating world, lots of replayability, and a raft of tweaks and improvements over the original make this one an easy sell. We’d recommend this to anyone looking for a big-budget 3D platformer that does things a little differently from the genre norms, and of course to anyone who considers themselves an avid Disney fan.",0.8,3
"Epic Mickey Rebrushed is a wonderful reminder of why the original is one of the best Disney games of all time, taking you on a charming journey full of fun levels, great characters, an enjoyable story, and a much-improved camera.",0.8,3
"I’m delighted to see Epic Mickey getting a second shot at life, and escaping exclusivity after all these years. This isn’t some landmark 3D platformer, but it’s a game with an incredible amount of heart put into it. While I would have loved to see this remaster do a bit more to smooth over the rough edges in game design, its respectful approach to updating the visuals is excellently done. Performance unfortunately isn’t perfect on the Switch, though it isn’t game breaking either. This is and always has been a game that will appeal to a very specific combo of 3D platforming and Disney fans, but for that audience it remains a flawed but charming trip into the forgotten past.",0.75,3
"The insufferable camera has been corrected, fast travel has been added, there are more collectibles to obtain, and new movement skills that make it not feel slow. For its part, the graphics have undergone a touch-up that will please both insiders and outsiders, although it was not optimized in the best way on all platforms.",0.7,3

"For the Dark Souls fan this is a dream come true. For an open-world game this is a strong statement in a stale, oversaturated and by the book field of games. For a videogame, Elden Ring is a triumph right there with every iconic game that came before it. With unparalleled game design and a captivating sense of adventure, this is the best game FromSoftware ever made.",1.0,2
"Apart from the summoning issue that is found when attempting to play with others, Elden Ring is a triumph. It looks great, it plays like a dream and it provides a world in which you can spend hours, just wandering about, picking fights.",1.0,2
"Elden Ring is a crowning achievement for FromSoftware and undoubtedly the very best gameplay experience they've yet delivered - and that's really saying something given this developer's incredible back catalogue. The Lands Between deftly combine breathless open world exploration, stunning artistry, immaculate world-building and wondrous adventure with classic Dark Souls combat and dungeon-crawling, resulting in not just the best Souls game to date, but a candidate for one of the very best video games ever made.",1.0,2
"FromSoftware has combined everything they learned while designing their past games and created something that will stand as a benchmark for years to come. Elden Ring is probably the most accessible game in their Soulsborne series, but it is very difficult. This difficulty and the esoteric nature of their design isn’t for everyone, but if you like fantasy RPGs there is no question as to whether you should give this a try. The amount of enjoyment, excitement, wonder, and reward I have felt while playing this game is unmatched. I don’t think I’ve ever experienced anything like it before. Elden Ring is easily the best game I’ve played so far this year, and I know it’s early but it should be in the discussion when talking about the greatest games of all time.",1.0,2
"Elden Ring rewards your curiosity in many ways, be it items, runes or a pathway to another area, but mostly it’s a story to tell your friends when you are sharing tales around the bonfire. It does not force feed tutorials down your throat, but instead it leans far the opposite way by not telling you much at all and lets you explore and find things out on your own. There is no true quest log, no points of interest on a map or no arrows pointing you in the right direction, so there is a good chance you’ll miss some of the best caves and areas of the game. Because of all of this, Elden Ring is forcing me to find all of that out on my own and it is one of the most rewarding games I have ever played. I will continue to explore the Land Between for many hours to come. I’m just not in a hurry.",1.0,2
"Elden Ring is an epic. With a beautifully designed open world, FromSoftware takes the Souls formula to new heights and crafts a journey that needs to be played.",0.95,2
"Despite some annoying performance issues, Elden Ring is a masterpiece. The combat, enemy variety, exploration, music, and open world are top notch. I’ve been playing it daily across all platforms alongside other games all month, and look forward to doing that all year as I try new builds, help friends, and try to do everything I want in this triumph of a video game.",0.95,2
"Elden Ring manages to draw the player into a fascinating world for many hours, with refined gameplay that fits perfectly with the freedom granted to the player. A sumptuous but imperfect work, which fails to completely overcome some of the historical flaws of Hidetaka Miyazaki's productions. Flaws that, however, can't diminish the scope of a masterpiece destined to leave an indelible mark on the videogame world and to set new standards for the souls-like and open-world genres.",0.92,2
"Elden Ring is a real milestone for its developers and one of the best titles we've played in the last few years. The way it mixes the gameplay from Dark Souls with a highly refined exploration offers a really fresh take on the saturated open world market. Despite some notable technical issues, they don't put a stain in the great taste of what promises to be one of the games that leaves a mark on a whole genre, and maybe, the best game From Software has ever developed.

"With its new open-world dimension, Elden Ring brilliantly fleshes out FromSoftware's already highly effective formula and offers Souls a spiritual sequel that is both ambitious and accessible. All the new features converge towards this last objective: the open world allows you to arm yourself more than ever with the epic and obligatory fights that the adventure reserves, without having the impression of walking around just to farm. And the best part is that it doesn't compromise the sense of accomplishment so important to the genre. Elden Ring is a complete, mysterious experience, where curiosity is tirelessly renewed by the feeling of discovering something for the first time. All with a sumptuous artistic direction, which makes you want to get lost, to explore. The title also welcomes new features that offer strategic choices in combat, without betraying their requirement. We only regret a slight lack of ambition for certain Legacy Dungeons, as well as the recycling of some assets and bosses. Overall, an exceptional title. ",0.9,2
"Elden Ring offers up a gorgeous open world that is enticing and exciting to explore, along with excellent combat variety, amazing bosses to fight, and intricate dungeons to tackle. It might feel a little familiar, but this could well be FromSoftware’s best game to date. ",0.9,2
Elden Ring is a perfect experience for every souls veteran and its welcoming enough for the newcomers. It is a true evolution of the souls-like type of action RPG.,0.9,2
"The sense of wonder and magic as you make your way around this mysterious and grimly beautiful world is truly extraordinary and while that does taper off somewhat by the time you reach the endgame and have seen more or less everything the game has to offer — several times over, in a lot of cases — but that doesn't detract too much from what will have otherwise been a truly remarkable adventure. Souls haters shouldn't fall for the rebrand as they'll just get burned again — Elden Ring is very much 'just' From doing what From does best, this time performing its greatest hits on the biggest stage to date. And what a wonderful thing that is to witness.",0.9,2

"What ultimately matters, however, is that Elden Ring succeeds at almost every goal it sets out to achieve. It’s the culmination of years of refinement of FromSoftware’s formula. Mechanically, and thematically, this is a game making a statement: that you can buck industry tendencies even as you adopt their trends. ",1.0,2
"Elden Ring challenged me, captivated me, and enchanted me, an unyielding deluge of discovery and artistic vision unbound. Elden Ring represents a truly amazing combination of various game elements that all come together to create something fascinating, special, and unforgettable. Elden Ring isn’t just the best game this year; it’s one of the best games ever made.",1.0,2
"FromSoftware’s most ambitious title yet, Elden Ring is a glowing spectacle of achievement. A refined open-world format adds unimagined wonder to the game, whilst legacy dungeons will likely go down as some of FromSoftware’s best level design. Beyond that, there are so many improvements to the Souls formula that make this an essential play for fans – this is a game that brings so much to the table, yet somehow leaves nothing out.",1.0,2

"There is no way around it; Elden Ring is a masterpiece. From Software's iconic gameplay, set in a vast and wonderful world, sucks us right in and never lets go. Even though the hand-holding is close to zero, Elden Ring will surely attract new players due to its more forgiving openness. A must play.",1.0,2
"Elden Ring absolutely manages to deliver on what was promised, and is, despite some minor annoyances, one of the finest gaming experiences I’ve had in years. That’s not only due to the rock-solid gameplay foundation, with its flexible class system, versatile weapons and progression mechanics. It’s also not only because of the morbid, dense atmosphere and the mysterious, captivating setting. It isn’t even solely the open world, which makes me want to spend every spare second exploring it with its gorgeous, monumental vistas and densely packed locations. Instead, the masterful combination of all these great qualities is what really makes Elden Ring special. Yes, the game has stopped me in my tracks multiple times, forcing me to leave bosses and places for later due to the somewhat slower progression system. But every time it does, it offers up dozens of other locations to test my mettle, become stronger and more skilled. And this cycle of trial and triumph is so immensely engaging that it’s going to keep me entertained for months to come.",1.0,2

"Elden Ring is a walking example of a 10 out of 10 game that isn’t perfect. No game can be perfect but there is just so much in here to love that it becomes hard to pay attention to its mistakes. Every handful of hours had the game open up more and, every time, I was desperate to keep searching, exploring, conquering. Now, over 100 hours later and two playthroughs, all I want is to discover more of what Elden Ring has in store for me. This isn’t just one of the best From Software titles but one of the best games I’ve ever played and I would be shocked if this didn’t have reverberations on the entire games industry.",1.0,2
"It’s been my sincerest pleasure experiencing FromSoftware’s latest work. Elden Ring is a landmark title that I hope shapes the future of what this industry can do; maybe we can one day point at this time in 2022 and note that this is when gaming took a giant leap. At risk of “laying it on thick” and coming off as hyperbolic, in my more than 30 years of gaming, I have almost never played a title that so neared perfection. I’ve devoted 80 blissful hours to Elden Ring, and at no point was I not enjoying myself or captivated by this world. My wish is that this team continues to receive the support it deserves and graces us with more opportunities to lose ourselves in the fantastic.",0.99,2
"Elden Ring is built upon a huge epic world and it is by farther best game in the Soul series in terms of map extensiveness and operability of battle system. More than just the worthiest successor of the Soul series, this game has broken free from the past shortcomings and constraints of the series and comes as an unparalleled master piece. It is a very enjoyable journey venturing into this world rich in details and full of challenges worth exploring.",0.98,2

Despite this, it's an incredible experience and will be one of the best games you’ll play this year.",0.95,2
"Any new From Software game comes with a lot of expectations, and Elden Ring delivers. It's a thrilling adventure that provides a wonderful sense of discovery through an expertly crafted world, seamlessly incorporating the excellent combat and encounters the studio is known for. The level of difficulty may be off-putting for some, but Elden Ring is so fantastic that it's absolutely worth fighting through to the end.",0.95,2
Elden Ring is everything we dream of and much more. It is the natural evolution of a franchise that has captivated several generations and is now ready to capture many more. Elden Ring will be the most talked about game of the next decade. It's proof that FromSoftware is a master of its craft and a testament that it dominates the genre it has created. Those who try to do something similar will remain mere imitators: they will never reach the level of sophistication achieved in Elden Ring.,0.95,2
"While no one wants to call Game of the Year in March, Elden Ring stands at the top of a very tall hill. If you play one game this year, make it Elden Ring. ",0.95,2
"Dark Souls fans rejoice! Elden Ring is exactly the game you have been hoping it would be, I think, and it is created in grand style. I feel pretty frustrated that the keyboard controls are either so broken or so poorly laid out that I just couldn’t figure them out, and I spent a lot of time trying to (and where some things lie in the menu system are crazy counterintuitive), and I installed it on two different machines to see if it was a hardware problem (note: didn’t help). Elden Ring actually made me want to go back and play Skyrim again, because it always seemed to me that GUI was very well laid out and just made sense. But for you gamepad guys, sharpen up your sword and get in there. You have blood to spill (a lot of which may be your own).",0.95,2
"Despite some technical glitches, Elden Ring has managed to be a satisfying, surprising and fully-experienced game.",0.95,2
"You will enjoy this game if you can stomach the abuse that Elden Ring dishes out. Even if you cannot, there is so much out there that you can do if you aren't afraid of running from scary fights. Some locations can be less fun than others, and some bosses create skill-based stopgaps. Elden Ring is all about picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and sometimes finding something more enjoyable to do. It's worth the investment.",0.95,2
"Every once in a while, a game comes around that takes the world by storm, becoming an instant classic. Not only is Elden Ring one such game, it is also one of the most profound among them. FromSoftware’s first foray into the open world genre is nothing short of breathtaking. It effortlessly balances exploration and tough-as-nails action gameplay in a way that has seldom been seen before. While not entirely flawless, it manages to instill a sense of wonder that will make even the most hardened of players feel like a kid again. Although it stumbles, Elden Ring is still leaps and bounds ahead of the competition.",0.95,2
"An extraordinary sum of the knowledge From Software gained during the years. A bona fide peak of the soulslike genre, enormous and brutal, and capable of magnifying both the bad aspects of the genre and the good ones. The great parts greatly obscure the bad ones though, making for a game that will be talked about for a long time.",0.94,2

"Elden Ring is a superb take on the soulslike genre, an astonishing evolution and a decisive step forward for From Software's scale of ambition. Elden Ring is a dream come true for every fan of Miyazaki's works.",0.93,2
"I can't say if Elden Ring will be something genuinely new or more of the same to players who have already battled through the other From Software titles, but playing it felt to me like something I haven't experienced before. I was incredibly stressed, I considered quitting out of frustration several times, but I never stopped having fun and wanting to play just a little bit longer.",0.93,2
"Elden Ring is the sum of FromSoftware's experience, poetics and playful approach: a title in which the undisputed skills of the team converge and explode.",0.92,2

"With Elden Ring, FromSoftware adds new ingredients to the Dark Souls formula, creating a world that is an absolute masterpiece. Combat remains as fluid as we’re used to, providing us with even more tools to master and ignite our sadomasochistic tendencies. The game's plot is often impenetrable and requires a tremendous investment to decipher it, but they payoff is there, if have the time and soul to endure it.",0.9,2

"After having finished my first playthrough of Elden Ring. I immediately want to play it again. I have never experienced that with an open-world game before - usually, I find myself thankful such behemoth games are over. FromSoftware has managed to nimbly incorporate its deliberate and challenging action RPG gameplay into an open world with a huge sense of freedom. The fact that they accomplished this feat without compromising on difficulty or narrative is a true marvel. Managing to also avoid almost all of the pitfalls of conventional open-world design is a step beyond even that. Even if you're fatigued over the familiar trappings of dark fantasy soulslike games in particular, Elden Ring is a masterful refinement of the formula that is the current zenith of its form - and it deserves glowing recognition.  ",0.9,2
"A gorgeous and wonderful open world adventure full of discovery, magic, and the same threat that exemplifies FromSoftware's Souls series. Elden Ring is more than another Dark Souls Game, mixing a natural evolution of the series with an open world concept and a greater level of accessibility for those that want to experience the infamous You Died screen.",0.9,2
"It’s hard to review Elden Ring without being comparative; that’s because Elden Ring is an evolutionary step, not a revolutionary one, and one can’t help but see how it’s built on what came before. Here is a massive undertaking of a game, not for the sake of chasing trends but as the natural progression of the style the company has been fostering for over a decade. It’s amazing how smoothly the transition to open world was and how much of the Souls identity is still present. In the short time since its release, it has already left a cultural mark, no doubt a result of the game’s increased approachability. Even after sifting past all the hype and grandiosity, there’s still an excellent game left and Elden Ring is a clear showcase of FromSoftware’s outstanding expertise in the field. Elden Ring really is just that good.",0.9,2
"Elden Ring is massive, sometimes to its detriment. A thorough walkthrough might take up more than 100 hours to complete, and at some point it becomes clear that From Software did not have enough manpower to produce that much unique content. Still, it remains incredibly addictive even after those 100 hours pass…",0.82,2
"While the technical issues of the barebones PC port and the familiar trappings of the open world formula substantially soured my experience, Elden Ring is still an impressive achievement of fusing compelling world design, exploration and combat. ",0.8,2
"Elden Ring is a new gold standard for open-world game design, dishing out some of the best freeform exploration since The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Curiosity is rewarded at every turn and secrets truly feel secret. For Souls veterans, the number of tools available adds a new level of depth to its combat that makes constant experimentation worthwhile. Even with those strengths, it’s hard to outright ignore the ugly quirks in FromSoftware’s games, which stick out even more on new tech. A stubbornness to fix archaic issues holds back what should be a once-in-a-generation game, but Elden Ring is still a landmark accomplishment in any case.",0.8,2
"Elden Ring is a potentially great game that is hindered by massive performance issues. It doesn’t do anything particularly genre-defining, as it mostly sticks to what FromSoftware always does. It will no doubt please fans of the Dark Souls series. But its lack of accessibility options and somewhat restrictive multiplayer may leave some wanting. Ultimately, I think it will potentially offer a better experience down the line, as the day-one patch has already changed some fundamentals of the game. With no real improvement regarding its performance on PC, Elden Ring is a hard game to recommend until a more stable version is available.",0.7,2
"Elden Ring is a wonderful action-RPG that features thrilling combat, an amazing open world, and tons of replay value. Unfortunately, its PC performance needs work.",0.7,2
"Elden Ring is an experience that will not be forgotten in a hurry. It's a tremendous, hulking, massive achievement but because it is tremendous, hulking and massive, it is one that comes with many caveats. The shelves in CeX and conversations with people who stopped playing at Stormveil castle can certainly attest to some of those caveats. Much like any FromSoftware title, it's not going to be for everybody, but paradoxically it is one of their hardest and one of their most accessible to date. It offers huge value in one package, and perhaps is a little too much value, only becoming clearer when nearing the endgame. Don't be mistaken by the criticism, though. This is a phenomenal achievement with a moment-to-moment that is incredibly engaging and immersive. No doubt it will be deserving of the end-of-year accolades it will inevitably receive. One pushes through Elden Ring as one pushes through life, with all the highs and the lows that it brings.",0.7,2
"That's the thing about Elden Ring, its open world has your back, in its own - often painful - way. Souls has always been about inching through claustrophobic corridors and bashing your skull against whatever's in the way. You compare foreheads with friends, ""Look at this bruise Barry, that's me five hours in"". And Barry would probably peel his hair back and reveal the exact same bruise. Adventures in past Souls games tend to line up, as you're all wandering down the same pathways. But that's not the case with Elden Ring. You might show your bruise to Barry and he'll peel his hair back to reveal a scar or a massive indent or a tattoo of a mouse tustling with a skeleton. Both of may be five hours in but you'll be on totally different trajectories. No matter how hostile the game's world may be, it pushes you to succeed and carve out your own adventures. It is, by far, the most encouraging Souls yet. [RPS Bestest Bests]",-0.01,2
"While this is probably the most accessible game the studio has made, it’s still incredibly demanding. It remains hard as hell, but now you have more options for dealing with the frustrating moments. And not only does it demand your focus and attention in a way few other games do, but now, because it’s so large, it demands much of your time as well. After 40 hours of exploring, I don’t think I’m even close to finishing the game; sometimes, it feels like I’m just getting started. Elden Ring isn’t a game you pop on for an hour a night. It’s a game that consumes you. For me, it’s becoming a lifestyle, something I still think about when I set the controller down.",-0.01,2
"Twenty-five hours in, I still have no idea what I’ll see next. It's a testament to Elden Ring that I'm so excited at the possibilities that remain, but it's also a problem that after all this time, I feel like it needs to show me more than it has so far.",-0.01,2

Even if you've never heard of Baldur's Gate or dabbled in Dungeons and Dragons, there's at least one part of the game that will intrigue you. The narrative is expertly structured, combat is innovative and promotes ingenuity, and you can seamlessly enjoy your adventure alone or with friends. A game with this much freedom and content is going to entertain you for hours (literally I've played 50 hours of this game and I'm just scratching the surface).

With top class combat, writing, acting and world-building hiding all of the terrifying intricacies of a refreshed D&amp;D rulebook, letting us players just get on with the fun stuff, there really is no finer adventure to take in 2023.

This role-playing game retains all of the content of the PC version (even local cooperation via split screen) and offers an optimal controller experience. The few faults of BG3 are still present (in particular the “pad” interface), but for the rest, it is flawless.",0.95,1

Flawlessly succeeding in what most choice-based narrative games seem to fall short of perfecting, the freedom of choice is endless. The D&amp;D based gameplay sticks close to its roots, with a blend of genres and lore as well as the implementation of the ever-present dice roll and turn-based combat. After ""only"" 80 hours of gameplay, every moment of my playthrough has engulfed me in a sense of childlike wonder which comes from a well crafted piece of fantasy.

While Splitscreen has some issues with lag during casting and conjuration, there was nothing that stopped us from playing hours and hours together. Online Multiplayer is a breeze to set up and works so well considering how much goes into Baldur’s Gate III as a whole. If you're looking to jump into the world of Baldur’s Gate but don't have a PC built for it, the PS5 version is here to save the day. ",0.95,1
"PS5 receives a superb port of Baldur's Gate 3, which has not sacrificed any content and technical cuts are negligible, unless you've played it before on a high-end PC.

The result is a masterpiece of a game that raises the bar for the genre. Baldur’s Gate III excels in every area, from music to graphics to story to gameplay. It’s a difficult task to recreate the open-ended possibilities of tabletop gameplay within a video game, but this is arguably the best attempt at doing so to date.

"It’s almost ridiculous, then, what’s been achieved here. Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t without its technical wrinkles, but it’s a full-fledged, fully fleshed-out, absolutely massive title with lofty production values across the board. That Larian Studios has intentionally willed something like this into the world at a time when AAA projects in this vein are so scarce only helps it shine, and serves as a fine reminder that the genre doesn’t need to transform, no matter what some publishers may believe - it just needs to adapt, to evolve, and to boldly present a compelling and cohesive vision all its own.

"Larian promised a game experience like at the role-playing table that would not be inferior to the old classics. Surprisingly, the only promise they didn't keep is a release on Stadia. Well, we'll get over it.",1.0,1
"Like with the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Baldur's Gate 3 feels like an impossible video game. Everything it does flies in the face of modern gaming and it fulfils almost all of its goals with a tactician's precision and clarity. From its stellar story with hundreds, if not thousands, of meaningful choices and consequences which make every single playthrough special, to the deep and compelling combat which you can spend an age learning, to its impeccable world and sound design, Baldur's Gate 3 is truly something special. While it isn't perfect and stumbles here or there, especially in terms of bugs and technical performance, it would be a crying shame for anyone to miss out on a masterpiece like this. Baldur's Gate 3 is my personal game of the year and I beg everyone who is even remotely interested to try it out.",1.0,1

And even if developers of large studios fight tooth and nail against it: This role-playing game sets new standards, and future RPGs will have to be measured against it. It is a video game in its purest form that holds a mirror up to the industry. It shows us how video games used to be and how they should be, something the industry has forgotten far too often. It is a work of art, born from the passion and love of a studio that has not been corrupted by the industry's rampant greed. You can tell in every fiber of Baldur's Gate 3 that it wasn't created to generate maximum revenue. Instead, it is a product of the love for video games that characterizes Creative Director Swen Vincke and his team.",1.0,1
"Baldur’s Gate 3 is a new benchmark for what RPGs can be. Its wealth of variety in how its story can unfold, and the insane amount of options for how players can approach different combat and exploration scenarios, make it a must play for just about anyone.

The endless possibilities create the true feeling of an open world that doesn't lead you in a way and gives the player a way to explore the story in limitless opportunities.",1.0,1
"Simply put, Baldur’s Gate 3 is a masterpiece. Larian Studios has done such a phenomenal job at bringing back an IP that has laid dormant since 2000 (2013 if you count the Baldur’s Gate 2 remaster – I, do not) and inadvertently put out a game that spits in the face of contemporary, predatory game design. While I don’t think it will be the new standard of RPGs, I think it stands as an example for aspiring RPG developers that, when given the appropriate amount of time, an RPG does not have to conform to the lifeless norms that the AAA industry has fed us for so many years. Larian, you have truly outdone yourselves, and your work will more than likely stand as one of the greatest achievements in gaming.",1.0,1

"Baldur's Gate 3 manages to pull off the spontaneity and unpredictable nature of a long-stretching Dungeons and Dragons tabletop game. The story is intriguing with beautifully woven side quests but never feels like it's forcing you in a set moral direction. You can be as lawful good, or chaotically evil as you wish from scene to scene, and the game will be a different experience for each and every player. Character voice acting, motion capture, and a spellbinding soundtrack make the game world feel alive and the storytelling compelling. The only limit to your experience is your imagination and creativity, and while the sheer volume of possible outcomes can lead to bugs and occasional immersion-breaking moments, Larian has ultimately achieved its ambition for a generation-defining RPG.",1.0,1
"BG3 is a highwater mark for choice-driven RPGs and the new standard to which basically every other major RPG will be compared. I feel bad for Starfield at this point and for game developers in general. Larian Studios has set the bar incredibly high. Still, I hope other publishers will see it as an example to let developers have time and creative freedom to make incredible games without all the bloated live service and microtransaction bullshit. Also, you can play this game in four-player online co-op or even split-screen locally on a single PC, and in this day and age, that may be one of the most impressive features in BG3.

"In case you couldn’t tell, I f.cking love this game....Baldur’s Gate 3 is truly exemplary, one of the few videogames in history that wholly deserve the universal acclaim heaped so freely upon releases above a certain marketing budget. The choices offered to the player in terms of both crafting an adventurer and influencing the story do an incredible job of translating Dungeons &amp; Dragons to a form of interactive software that surpasses the loftiest expectation. The script is incredible, the gameplay beneath it downright luxurious. There won't be another like this in a long, long time. ",1.0,1
"Near the end of Baldur's Gate 3, a character says, ""Too much freedom can be frightening."" It's a powerful line within the context of the story, but it also speaks to Baldur's Gate 3 on a deeper level. The freedom that it offers is unprecedented, and it takes a little while to really see the scope of what that means for the game. At times, the sheer number of choices and consequences can be overwhelming. But before long, it becomes apparent that Baldur's Gate 3 allows players to be the authors of their own destinies in a way no other game has before. It's that freedom and reactivity paired with its excellent presentation and fantastic characters that really set Baldur's Gate 3 apart, and it's why after 200 hours I'm still coming back to it. Too much freedom can be frightening, but Larian trusts its players to make the most of it, for better or for worse.",1.0,1

It’s a masterpiece in both design and implementation, with only some pervasive performance issues and gameplay bugs to sometimes drag the experience down. Still, the narrative, graphic design, voice performances, and tactical gameplay do a lot to bring the experience back up to amazing.",0.95,1
"A mind blowing game, that consecrates Larian Studios as one of the greats of the RPG genre, and will probably have the same impact today that its predecessors had in their age. It's a superb and brilliant game, that we wholly recommend to anyone who loves the genre, or deep video games in general.",0.95,1
"Baldur's Gate 3 is the best RPG in years. The game is not made for everyone and has a steep learning curve, especially for non-D&amp;D players. But those willing to dive in will find a game that offers you more freedom of choice than we've ever seen in peers.",0.95,1
"Baldur's Gate 3 deserves the title of Game of the Year, plain and simple. Having sunk around 100 hours into the game since its launch, and with the city of Baldur's Gate still a distant sight, it's a challenge to tear myself away from the captivating narrative I've woven. Both my impressions from the early access phase and my time with the full release have remained consistent: the game is a masterpiece.",0.95,1
"Larian has built one of the most intricate virtual worlds I’ve ever seen and, despite a few hiccups, Baldur’s Gate 3 remains the finest example of its genre available today.",0.95,1
"What to say, what to do... if not to bow humbly in front of so much talent. Larian Studios once again proves its expertise in the field of role-playing games and even manages to sublimate the rich and complex universe of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Baldurs' Gate 3 is quite simply the best D&amp;D video game adaptation ever made. This adventure “of which you are the hero” shines with its generosity, its mastery of the codes of the genre and this constant desire to surpass oneself. BG3 can boast of being the ultimate video game experience for role-players, but not only. Admittedly, this RPG requires a good PC to play in optimal conditions and proves to be a bit tough to learn, especially for the uninitiated. But to play Baldur's Gate III is to create your own story, a story that belongs only to you. Just for that (and more), the pleasure is total!",0.95,1
"Baldur’s Gate 3 is unforgettable and one of the best experiences I’ve had in games. I may have just finished my lengthy first playthrough, but I’m already eager to delve further and push the boundaries of what’s possible in this exceptional world that Larian created.",0.95,1
"Ultimately Baldur's Gate 3 is, in no uncertain terms, a shining jewel of design and programming, so deep, layered and sumptuous that it can be considered the new golden standard of the genre: a benchmark of prodigious magnitude that will be a real nightmare for anyone want to embark, in the future, on the development of titles belonging to the same category. Where many would have crashed to the ground by replicating the myth of Icarus and the Sun, Larian Studios triumphs and brings a sequel to PC that in many ways even surpasses its illustrious predecessors. In short, the throne of the best RPG of the generation has just been claimed.",0.95,1
"Faerûn is a unique world. The story of Baldur's Gate 3 is outstanding. Coupled with gameplay that knows how to effectively mix the turn-based system with its exploration in real time. A ten music that manages to transport us to a fantasy environment that has a looming danger. The building of relationships, the enemies and the dangers that we will find in Faerûn, make this Larian adventure almost 100% complete. A game that will go down in history and remain in the hearts of millions of players forever. Highly recommended.",0.95,1
"I could easily keep talking about this game, from the romance scenes that honestly had a lot of heart put into them or about various small encounters that I had just roaming around the map. Baldur’s Gate 3 may not be a one-to-one recreation of a system that many of us know, but that doesn’t hold it back in any form. Instead, the spirit of Dungeons &amp; Dragons is inside the very fiber of Baldur’s Gate 3; it can sometimes be silly and outlandish. However, there is a lot to love here, and there aren’t many words that could really convey how much I love this game and glad that while the battle system may not be what I expected, once I adjusted myself to it, it gave me almost everything else I could want out of a game.",0.95,1
Baldur's Gate 3 is an exceptionally well-written game with breathtaking visuals and charming NPCs. The game's combat is creative and allows all sorts of maneuvers that you can think of. Larian Studios's CRPG shows that the genre can be accessible and brings the best out of Dungeons &amp; Dragons: a universe of peculiar beings that unite under a greater good.,0.95,1
"We praised Larian a lot for  Divinity: Original Sin 2, but Baldur's Gate 3 is without a doubt their masterpiece. It's an experience that deserves its name in every sense and trilogizes the Baldur's Gate saga in a spectacular way. If it makes up for its shortcomings with an Enhanced Edition, we can easily call it one of the best games of the 2000s.",0.95,1
"Fans of cRPG couldn't have hoped for a better sequel of one of the most revered franchises in the history of this genre. Larian Studios should be proud for setting new standards, creating a  highly ambitious reactive world filled to the brim with quality content, accompanied by a deep combat system and excellent writing.",0.95,1
"There are good games and great games, and then there are games that change the game entirely. Baldur’s Gate III is that rare case that charts its own route, building on the best of what came before it and breaking new ground. With how responsive the game is to the specifics of your created character, it could be explored virtually forever with endless new stuff to discover tucked into millions of little corners. The world is intricate and wonderous enough to want to live in it, and the characters are so intriguing that you cherish every conversation and want to save them all from themselves (and good luck doing that!). It’s an explosion of the imagination so powerful that it’s unthinkable that Larian was able to fit it all into one game, but they did. So, gather your party and venture forth!",0.95,1
"An incredible detailed and large game, Baldur's Gate 3 is a joy for RPG fans and fans of the pen and paper game as well.",0.95,1
"Baldur's Gate 3 is an epic game, not so much for any individual element, but rather for the sum of its parts. The result is certainly what fans have been waiting for for far too many years. Great job, Larian.",0.93,1
Baldur’s Gate 3 is a great adventure that's fun to be in. I adore this game despite all the potential pitfalls. Its freedom and possibilities really stand out – I think the only game that could rival this RPG would be Fallout: New Vegas.,0.9,1
"Baldur’s Gate 3’s world is beautiful, layered, and complex, and challenges you to attack it how you want. The story is compelling, giving your decisions a weight rarely seen in games of this scope. It is a marvel, and easily one of the best RPGs ever made. ",0.9,1
A brilliant and impressive journey that adapts to your every move.,0.9,1
"An excellent follow-up to its decades-old predecessor, Baldur's Gate III sets a new gold standard for RPGs in the modern age. Though it has its fair share of buggy problems, the vibrant world, intriguing storytelling, and captivating gameplay more than make up for its shortcomings.",0.9,1
"An incredible achievement in role-playing game design, in terms of the level of freedom and interactivity – although even ignoring the bugs it’s not quite as consistent as you might hope.",0.9,1
"It has heart, it has style, and it has the multi-year effort of a studio that obviously loves its source material. The mind-blowing size of the game itself and everything contained within is a testament to Larian Studios' dedication to its craft and commitment to bringing something incredible to the gaming public.",0.9,1
"Baldur's Gate III is everything an RPG adventure should be. It's appropriately epic while also spending time with the small moments. It allows you to feel powerful while also rewarding you for being clever and avoiding trouble. It offers the class fantasy of everything from a stalwart paladin to a hellish abomination, from fast-talking trickster to rage-filled barbarian. It has its quirks and flaws, but they usually add welcome texture to the game. Perhaps most importantly of all, it captures the feeling of sitting down and playing through a D&amp;D adventure with some friends.",0.9,1
"Far from being a simple sequel to a cult license, Baldur's Gate 3 is a new monument to role-playing. It never ceases to impress, both in terms of its high-quality production and its incredible richness on every level. But perhaps the most astonishing thing is the sheer range of possibilities on offer, almost unheard of for a game of this scale and complexity. It's a great adventure in which you can progress in your own way, without feeling restricted. The game has almost everything it takes to become a new absolute reference in the genre, and apart from a few finishing and interface problems, the criticism that can be levelled at it is that it may prove too much of a chunk for many players. You need to have hundreds of hours ahead of you to really appreciate it fully.",0.9,1
"If you’re a fan of deep storytelling, strategic combat, and a world that responds to your every action, Baldur’s Gate 3 is an adventure you won’t want to miss. The path ahead is treacherous and filled with uncertainty, but isn’t that what makes a journey truly unforgettable?",0.9,1
"Baldur’s Gate 3 may not be the most welcoming game to those not well-versed in the CRPG genre, but once you get past any initial hurdles, you’ll find one of the most profound and engrossing releases the genre has seen in the last decade. It allows so much freedom and so many options that it can be rather overwhelming, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. This is the sort of game I know I’ll be replaying to see more paths and more options for years to come.",0.9,1
"The RPG legend returned and took everyone's breath away. You will forgive its minor flaws because it offers an epic experience in a well-known fantasy universe. Although the basic principles of the game are mostly well known, the way in which the characters and the story are formed, with remarkable options that can change it dramatically, all this makes this game unique.",0.9,1
"Baldur's Gate 3 is a beacon of all the untapped potential in the CRPG genre. While it may be a bit much for newcomers, it's a gripping experience that no one with even an inkling of interest in the genre should miss.",0.9,1
"Baldur's Gate 3 is an outstanding and complete RPG. All of its elements work brilliantly and mesh together to create something unique. Calling this game a continuation of the series may be a bit controversial, but it doesn't change the fact that this game is as close to a masterpiece as it gets. Many things are executed much better than in the first two installments, and we finally feel that we have a real impact on the world and events. It's like taking part in the best session of a tabletop RPG.",0.9,1
The new benchmark for the RPG genre and masterfully crafted computer games in general.,0.9,1
"Baldurs Gate 3 is an exquisite example of a role-playing game, and an incredible recreation of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons experience. It is, in a word, unmissable.",0.9,1
"The first 60-70 hours were near-faultless, with Larian Studios providing an experience unmatched in the role-playing space. I could continue to nitpick over how I wished that ambition and quality could sustain right until the end credits, but then I think about the whole journey I went through with my Drow and I can't help but smile. Despite its late-game flaws, Baldur's Gate 3 is truly special.",0.9,1
"With a vast world to explore with varied stories and secrets to discover, Baldur's Gate 3 definitely shines. The cast is largely appealing and voice acting is top notch all-around, even if the storytelling and line delivery is varied in its pace. Character progression is somewhat weak in the opening levels but has a strong foundation for a great buildcraft experience, even if it lacks some on the fly experimentation seen in Larian's past efforts. Despite some performance woes in the later parts of the game and controller hangups, this is a journey worth taking for fans of Dungeons &amp; Dragons or those new to the role playing field.",0.9,1
"A fantastic role-playing game that shines with its story, its companions, its game world and decisions. Only bugs deny an even higher rating.",0.89,1
"Baldur's Gate 3 is a great cRPG that manages to meet the lofty expectations of the franchise name. With excellent writing, engaging story, flexible player choice and compelling mechanics, even its minor second-half stumbles can't prevent the game from getting some of the highest rolls in the genre.",0.85,1
"Baldur's Gate 3 is a top game that is definitely worth playing, if you are willing to put in the hours. It's excellently written, excellently acted and shows that you can make a game as big as this without having a drop in quality through things like stupid fetch quests. Of course a game of this size is not without bugs and it is difficult to get into without prior knowledge of Dungeons &amp; Dragons or Divinity, but besides that Baldur's Gate 3 is highly recommended.",0.85,1
"With excellent stagecraft and meticulous detail, Baldur's Gate 3 conjures the illusion of perfect freedom - and then it disappears.",0.8,1
Baldur's Gate 3 isn't a great game. It is a sloppy sketch of a great game.,0.78,1
"I’m still conflicted with how I feel about Baldur’s Gate III, and I probably will be for a while. While it carries on the legacy of perhaps one of the most influential CRPGs of all time, I’m not sure if it’s better than the first two games that preceded it. It is a different story by a different team and, while it’s deeply connected to those first two games, it is a promising start to more new adventures set in a familiar world that I’ve always loved.",0.7,1
"For now, I'm simply having a blast learning a lot of complex RPG systems that I've always struggled with in tabletop form. If its early momentum keeps up, Baldur's Gate 3 could be a quintessential RPG for both hardcore fans and newcomers. We'll just have to wait and see how it sticks the landing. [Review in Progress]",-0.01,1

Another remarkable feat of a streamlined tabletop experience by Larian Studios. [Early Impressions],-0.01,1

Nothing can ever truly recapture the freedom that imagination brings to a tabletop game. But Baldur’s Gate 3 is proof that Larian Studios knows how to capture that spirit and develop in pursuit of that feeling.,-0.01,1
"It's an incredible world to get lost in, and though it may take you 100 hours, you will want to play it again and try new things. It is, in summary, the best Dungeons &amp; Dragons game anyone has made, and probably ever will make - unless there's a sequel in another 20 years. [RPS Bestest Bests]",-0.01,1
"I look forward to playing, and replaying and replaying, Baldur’s Gate 3 for possibly years to come. It’s clearly a role-playing game classic and has already been an overwhelming success for Larian Studios. It’s just unfortunate that I end up comparing the relatively limited power of a video game to the power of my own imagination — and it also feels like a problem the game can’t solve. Baldur’s Gate 3 is a masterpiece of a D&amp;D game in every sense of the word, for good and, sometimes, for ill. [Polygon Recommends]",-0.01,1
"Baldur's Gate 3 is awesome. A superlative RPG that allows you play like you want it (almost) without limits. It missions design, story and graphics turn it in one of the best video games ever. [Recommended] ",-0.01,1
"By the time I reached the end of my journey and my nation stood above all the rest, I was left with one of the most satisfying gaming victories I’ve ever experienced. While Ara: History Untold asks a lot of players, it rewards those willing to put in the hours with a deeply rich gameplay experience that makes them feel like every choice they made shaped their nation and helped their people achieve greatness. From large-scale design innovations to the smallest details, the game delivers an almost flawless experience.",0.95,0
"Ara: History Untold is a complex 4X-strategy game that introduces an extensive crafting system and simultaneous turns, eliminating waiting times. Players win by earning Prestige in various categories rather than pursuing a specific victory condition. While the game offers rich details in leaders and visuals, it falls short with predictable events and limited cultural differences. It still offers an in depth and rewarding experience for any strategy enthusiasts.",0.9,0
"I absolutely enjoyed my time with Ara: History Untold, and I think anyone that’s enjoyed a round or two of the Civilization series will feel right at home with this. It also has a solid tutorial to help on-board new players, so even if you’ve never touched a 4X game before, I think you’ll find that Ara is friendly towards new players too. There’s a ton of different ways to build out your empires, and the use of a Prestige system as an option to victory, wherein you gain points for various actions taken, is a solid way of deciding a winner even if you have multiple nations still standing at the end of a game. Definitely check Ara: History Untold out when it launches this week, you won’t be disappointed.",0.9,0
"Ara: History Untold brings fresh ideas for a long-running genre, and more than stands on its own because of them.",0.9,0
"Ara: History Untold could be the first real-time strategy game capable of standing up to the Civilization series. A very well-crafted product, with priorities that allow for a unique experience, despite the direct relationship with such a specific genre. Its design is very well done, its execution is brilliant, and it is capable of captivating us with its battles and landscapes. Diverse, challenging, and entertaining, one of those games that takes us to a new dimension where we wish time would really stand still. It is a game that all strategy lovers should play.",0.85,0
"The development team behind Ara: History Untold succeeds in competing with the established titles of the genre with new ideas and creative gameplay, cleverly packing complex economic systems and production processes into a graphically sophisticated and lively framework while retaining the roots of its genre predecessors.",0.85,0
"Ara: History Untold doesn’t totally reinvent the grand strategy genre, but the changes it makes help create a fresh, engaging, and fun experience. All 4X games are dense with mechanics, decisions, and weighty outcomes. Ara: History Untold does a good job of navigating the player through its many options and paths to victory. Ara: History Untold beats the upcoming Civilization VII to the finish line, but the two approaches are different enough to sit side by side.",0.82,0
"I find it interesting to think about how the game will be received by fans of the genre. In my case, I think it is a production worth buying on day one if you like this type of strategy and I think it does well to move away from the shadow of Sid Meier's saga. Although this may be a bit of a drawback for the more traditionalists and a success for marketing, since we have to take into account that Civilization 7 is also just around the corner.",0.82,0
"ARA: History Untold is an incredibly deep game, but one that might be too slow and cumbersome for anyone who isn’t a diehard fan of the genre.",0.8,0
"We feel like we’ve only scratched the surface with Ara: History Untold even after thousands of turns and multiple games, but this is a fun take on this type of experience and a great choice if you’re looking for an engaging PC game to pull you in. If you don’t mind history with a bit of a twist and want a game where you can sink hours into each session as you overcome all sorts of challenges and triumph as a nation, Ara is well worth a look.",0.8,0
"Ara: History Untold is challenging the heavy hitters in a very competitive genre, but stands out thanks to its unique approach to 4X grand strategy and innovative mechanics. It's a gorgeous and polished turn-based strategy game that hooks you with ""one more turn"" and keeps you hooked with its flexible and varied strategy gameplay.",0.8,0
"It’s in these complications that Ara: History Untold shines brightest. It has seemingly learned core lessons from its forebears in the 4X genre, using them as stepping stones to advance its core gameplay loop, and provide new layers of depth where needed. Its more holistic approach to building nations, and its move away from war as singular motivator, makes it a very well-rounded, clever strategy game – and one that rewards your time and energy.",0.8,0
"Ara: History Untold feels really fresh, immersive, and innovative with its deep city-builder influences being the standout feature. It doesn’t nail the landing in all aspects, but provides the most exciting foundation for further expansion we’ve had in this genre for a long time.",0.8,0
"Ara: History Untold makes meaningful contributions to the well-worn grand strategy genre at every turn, even if the absurdities of its mix-and-match approach to history can be hard to swallow.",0.8,0
"Ara: History Untold is a vast strategy game that gives you plenty to do, but success consistently rewards you with new ways to play.",0.8,0
"With its challenging prestige elimination race proposition, Ara: History Untold is a relevant addition to the 4X genre, boasting some really nice detailed models, a very satisfying crafting optimization system, and a rather dense non-linear tech tree. Too bad the diplomacy is so frustrating and the concept shows some limitations after about fifteen hours of play.",0.8,0
"Ara: History Untold is another distinctive take on the historical 4X strategy genre, putting a real emphasis on furthering your nation, managing supply chains and resources, and shifting the focus away from warring mentality it's so easy to sink into. There's room to grow, but this is a strong contender.",0.8,0
"Despite a few issues, I still think Ara: History Untold is some of the most fun I’ve had with a 4X historical nations game that wasn’t Civilization. Oxide Studios clearly knew the assignment and they aced on a number of fronts. It’s a little disappointing that for their experience, they weren’t able to avoid common issues like mid-to-late grind, but if you want a game that will offer plenty of variety in playstyles and an interesting and engaging crafting mechanic, Ara: History Untold is quite an extensive option for any fan of 4X strategy.",0.8,0
An enticing strategy game that caters mostly to those who love to develop a culture and bringing it throught the eras. Deep and complex just at the right degree.,0.8,0
"Ara History Untold could be a great competitor to other strategy games, such as Civilization. It relies on an efficient turn-based system, which helps you plan your next steps, and a progressive storyline that makes it a pleasure to see everything evolve into the most modern world.",0.8,0
"Interesting mix of 4X strategy and construction game, which just manages to get an 80 rating with fresh ideas and depth.",0.8,0
"Ara: History Untold boldly launches into the 4X landscape, bringing with it some intriguing innovations. Although the game introduces the prestige system and non-hex maps, it remains faithful to the basic structure of many other congeners. In this sense, the production by Oxide Games is more of a refined restyling than a Copernican revolution. Its new mechanics undoubtedly offer fresh ideas and compelling challenges and the attention to the smallest details further elevates the value of Ara. However, the complexity in resource management and a war component that does not hold up to comparison with the rest of the experience are less brilliant aspects of the package. In any case, we are faced with a valuable production, capable of intriguing fans of the reference genre.",0.8,0
Quotation forthcoming.,0.8,0
"Although the detailed management of endgame item production can be a little time-consuming for my taste, the performance could be better, and diplomacy could well be implemented in a more elegant way, the game offers complex systems that are rewarding to get into. I hope that we continue to see innovations in this niche from the developers behind Ara: History Untold.",0.8,0
"There’s a lot to like about Ara: History Untold, even with the rough edges that appear every so often. Barring some performance issues, I’d say anyone even a little curious about the genre should give the game a shot and try it for themselves (especially if you have Xbox Game Pass). As for those of you with hundreds of hours in 4X games? Well, Civilization VII is still months away and Ara is a worthwhile competitor in the space and so I highly recommend playing at least a few games during this wait. Who knows, maybe you’ll find yourself with a new favourite in the genre…",0.78,0
"ARA: History Untold has all the ingredients to become a benchmark in the genre. Its innovative mechanics, such as simultaneous turns, the non-linear technology tree and the prestige system, give it a fresh air that distinguishes it from other strategy games.",0.77,0
"Ara: History Untold is a highly ambitious 4X game that looks to branch out and add even more depth to an already detailed genre. In many ways, it succeeds, bringing in a map and city-building system that far surpasses others in the genre and successfully interlinking practically every area. However, with some successes come issues, with the added depth in the supply chain making it a bit of a micromanagement nightmare; it tries to alleviate some of these issues with a user-friendly UI, but it could be a sticking point for some. The AI also seems to go on the fritz and break the game's rules.",0.75,0
"Ara: History Untold tweaks the Civilization formula, but doesn’t change it all that much. While it’s a well polished experience, I’m not sure it does enough to push the genre forward, settling instead to do what it does well. That said, good strategy games can be hard to find, and Ara is a good one in a crowded field.",0.75,0
"I’m glad there’s another historical 4X on the block - and for those of you who want something a bit meatier than Civ, I think this can fit the bill. ARA: History Untold is bold, innovative and exciting - but thoroughly held back by frustrating problems and an infuriating user experience. ",0.75,0
"In the end, it's a successful Civilization clone that excels in some ways and falls a little short in others. And the game is also graphically pleasing. It is definitely worth trying.",0.75,0
"Ara tries to reinvent the 4X wheel with a really exciting gameplay system. However, it lacks dynamism, a more interesting diplomatic and trade system and a bit of nastiness that makes us feel the political and social weight of our choices. If they raise it well, it can become an unforgettable game.",0.75,0
"Ara: History Untold dares a lot, but many things still don't work out as planned. It still falls short of its role model, Civilization.",0.74,0
"Ara: History Untold is a worthy representative of the strategy genre, offering innovative mechanics for those who particularly enjoy the building aspect of empire building games focused on diplomacy and warfare. Although many of its elements must be polished and refined to stand the test of time, the foundations are solid, and the future looks promising.",0.74,0
"Despite the inclusion of innovations like Prestige, which offers a more sophisticated appraisal of your leadership, Ara: History Untold doesn’t outshine Civilization. Instead, it feels like a lateral deviation, where some components are restructured but others flirt with tedium by the third and final act.",0.73,0
"Ara: History Untold is a decent foray into the historical 4X, with enough borrowed and slightly tweaked elements to make it worth a look for fans of the genre. Its original ideas become too much of a slog however, along with a scattering of UI issues and performance hiccups that need addressing. ",0.7,0
"A beautifully presented and accessible game in a sometimes obscure genre, Ara: History Untold is a pretty picture book rather than a deep tome. ",0.7,0
Ara: History Untold brings city-building to Civilization with strategic success.,0.7,0
"Ara: History Untold is beautiful to look at, offers complexity, and nails its concept with flying colours, but it lacks the customisation options its competitors offer, and is technically substandard. It has great potential to be a truly brilliant addition to the genre if the developers can fix the major technical issues, balance problems, and can update the title properly, turning the game into something that also survives the test of time.",0.7,0
"Ara: History Untold doesn't really do anything new, but it takes good ideas from so many games and combines them in a meaningful way that fans of Civ, Millennia or Humankind will definitely have fun with. However, some of the many systems – such as diplomacy or combat – aren't really polished. The game certainly has the potential to patch itself up, but at release it's not enough.",0.7,0
"Ara: History Untold was supposed to be the game that, after nearly eight years, could make us forget Civilization VI. However, it seems that once again, we'll have to wait for the seventh installment to lose ourselves, one turn at a time. The title, developed by Oxide Games, looks very promising. It has a visually striking graphical style and some interesting flashes of brilliance. However, it’s a strategy game whose core focus is hard to grasp, and it falls victim to overwhelming micromanagement that permeates every turn. This has drawn attention away from areas that needed more care, such as diplomacy, technology, and those essential late-game variations. ",0.65,0
"I'm certain that many fans of Civilization will quickly abandon playing ARA: History Untold. No Civ demands such careful consideration of the smallest details and micro-dependencies from the player. You need to ask yourself: do you want to conquer lands or manage the production of cement and ploughs? If the latter sounds interesting, you're right where you need to be.",0.65,0
"While Ara: History Untold is a visually captivating historical 4X with an interesting underlying economy, it gets bogged down well before the midway point, mainly because it doesn’t provide enough tools and UI support to manage all of the things it expects you to manage. Your choice of leader, religion, and government almost always simply add uninteresting passive modifiers, which means most playthroughs will feel roughly the same other than the layout of the map itself. I had a pretty decent time with my march through the ages, especially in the first of its three acts. But it did require me to eventually give up on trying to play optimally, passing turns without doing anything until I emerged victorious. A lot of these systems are exciting and clever in their design – they're just not that enjoyable to interact with past a certain point.",0.6,0
"Ara delves deeply into a single mechanic. Warfare, diplomacy, religion, and research are stripped down to the bare essentials, leaving the majority of your time focused on balancing the production of a massive array of materials and their interconnected, complex production chains. While this is initially engaging, it quickly becomes tedious in the later stages, where balancing production feels more like managing a budget before an accounting deadline.",0.6,0
"A good alternative to Civilization that could be even better with a little more optimization. Beautifully detailed world, interesting features and flexibility.",0.6,0
"I keep bringing up competitors like Civilization and Humankind not just for obvious comparisons or to be cruel, but because Ara: History Untold sought to position itself as big mix up for historical strategy. And I want that! I love this genre, but only having a few big games flying that banner has led to it becoming a bit stale, and more competitors and new ideas could shake things up. But unfortunately, Ara doesn’t do much to really drive things forward. Most of the new additions have been tried before and the crafting system, the one actually unique part, fails to add much more than extra busywork and spreadsheeting. It’s still totally functional as a historical 4X, easily alluring me back into the one-more-turn mindset, but it doesn’t succeed in bringing much that is really new to the table.",0.6,0
"While it does offer some strategy thrills, all of this really holds it back from being another genre kingpin. With DLC and future updates, it may have a chance to iron out its weaker aspects. But, outside a few unique twists, it feels like it is missing something to make it truly worth the price of admission.",0.6,0
"Ara is an interesting and enjoyable spin on the Civ concept but becomes unwieldy long before it's over. Figuring out how to build a thriving empire will be an enjoyable challenge to people looking for a certain kind of production chain game, but I don't see its malnourished AI and ballooning micromanagement keeping them around once they do.",-0.01,0
