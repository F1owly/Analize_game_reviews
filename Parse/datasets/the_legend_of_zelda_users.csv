In my opinion I think it tops links awakening. My only problems are the frame rate which can be an issue at times but not game breaking.,1.0,ENGLISH
"Simply the best Zelda game that represents its origins, combining with what Nintendo did best in the freedom present in Botw, the best Zelda of all time.",1.0,ENGLISH

"Although it is not traditional Zelda (as you do not play as Link), Echoes of Wisdom succeeds in being the 2d Zelda game we've all been hoping for. The gameplay is very fun, and the echoes are a very fun and creative game mechanic that sets this game apart from pretty much any other game. The level design is superb, as we finally have semi-traditional dungeons! They're admittedly quite easy, and the progression isn't based on items like it was previously (instead you progress forward using new unique Echoes the game gives you), but they're still very well-designed dungeons that use the Echo mechanic to make some of the most creative puzzles you'll ever see in a Zelda game. In terms of progression, they've managed to take the best of both worlds from both the open-air games and the linear titles of old, and this combination is essentially the best I was hoping for. The Echoes are often a bit janky though, they often don't do what you want them to do.",0.8999999999999999,ENGLISH

Interesante mezcla entre lo tradicional y lo antiguo. Creo que deja contento a los veteranos y a los fans que se han incorporado a la franquicia con Breath of the Wild y Tears of the Kingdom. Como siemrpe la jugabilidad es espectacular e innovadora. Muy recomendado!,1.0,SPANISH

Mixes enough old with the new to create a fresh new 2D Zelda experience that allows players to tackle challenges in their own way. Zelda’s future is looking bright.,0.8999999999999999,ENGLISH
"Brilliant traversal, actually good dungeons, and still having that classic Zelda feel. What’s not to love?",1.0,ENGLISH
Zelda as a character I always felt that she needed a game all centered around her someday. And boy did this one deliver!,1.0,ENGLISH
"Please bring back item-based progression. The older Zeldas were so much better at making the player feel accomplished when solving one-solution puzzles while engaging in actual combat as opposed to the open-ended Minecraft-styled gameplay. There's just so much in this game that takes from Tears of the Kingdom that it just bores me to tears. The new direction that Zelda games are going in is going to divide the fanbase even more than in the past few years, and I fear that it's only going to get worse with the release of the Switch's successor if nothing is done to properly address it.",0.3,ENGLISH

"Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom brings the princess back to the forefront, sealing her Triforce piece in an ingenious and delightfully engaging 2D adventure. Acting as a perfect bridge between the sprawling freedom of Breath of the Wild and the nostalgic charm of Link's Awakening, this title breathes new life into the Zelda franchise. Despite its fresh take, it remains undeniably a true Zelda game at heart, capturing the series' signature magic, puzzles, and sense of exploration. Standing tall alongside Super Mario Bros. Wonder, it showcases Nintendo's late-console brilliance and offers a masterclass in game design that other developers would do well to learn from. A magical experience not to be missed.",1.0,ENGLISH

"It's charming but holy cr*p is this game boring. Absolutely trivial puzzles that don't offer any challenge or enjoyment. It's not nearly as clever or interesting as it wants to be. It gives you the illusion that there are tons of options, but most of the time there's only one way to go about things. The only real choice you get is what ally you want to summon so you can just sit there and watch them fight for you, which just gets tedious. Definitely a subpar Zelda experience.",0.5,ENGLISH

"This game is a huge steaming pile of garbage. The greedy developers are charging $60 for a mobile game. This game copied and pasted so many assets from Link's Awakening 2019, it is the exact same game. First TOTK and now this? And you Zelda fans have the audacity to make fun of COD for being the same game every year, yet you have to wait at least half a decade to get the same game. The graphics are a joke. The physics are beyond horrible. The gameplay is boring and repetitive. No tree variety, you see the same tree copied and pasted everywhere. You can't open chests in real-time. The broken pieces of a pot or a flying tile magically fall under the ground, rather than landing on surface. Zelda's clothes don't get soaked nor does the water land on the surface, a basic detail PS3 games can get right. The UI is terrible. ● When I pay $60, I expect top-notch AAA quality. It's already bad enough that BOTW looks like an indie game, but the quality of this game is downgraded even further for the same price. Just look at the eyes for example, BOTW has the sclera, iris, and pupil whereas this trash only has the pupil, shaped like the ones you see on Steamboat Mickey Mouse. This was clearly a lazy attempt from the developers to avoid animating eyeball movements and blinking. Furthermore, the lazy developers used the top-down camera in a pathetic attempt to not have to design the fourth wall or roof in interiors. Speaking of which, there are no real-time interiors. It's the same trash as GTA San Andreas where you go inside a small building and you spawn in a giant ""interior"" that's clearly too big for it. Speaking of GTA SA, the characters' fingers are stuck together. It was pathetic in 2004 and I can't believe we have that same problem 20 years later. No voice acting. Dude, you can't be taking all these shortcuts and charge $60. I expect you developers to work hard for that price. ● One thing that frustrates me about video games is when developers prompt me to ""do it your way"" and they don't even allow me to do it my way. I ran into invisible walls or my abilities weren't working accordingly, all because I didn't do it the developer's way. I've noticed not a single ""AAA"" game has ever been able to achieve the open ended mission design since 2006. The closest AAA game (after 2006) I can think of that does ""open ended"" mission design right is GTA V, contrary to popular belief. Obviously I'm not talking about story mode, but the Online contact missions by Gerald, Simeon, Madrazo and others. In those missions, you get a few prompts and have complete freedom on how you want to do it, without ruining the logic of the mechanics. And if you can't make open-ended missions like that, then give me step by step instructions like GTA V story mode, because you're wasting my time. Many indie games absolutely nail the open ended level design, like Human Fall Flat. It's embarrassing when indie games do a better job at open-ended level design than ""AAA"" games. ● There is no multiplayer. So once you beat the story, there is literally not a reason to play this game again. Charging $60 for a game with no replay value is a cash grab. So all I get is a campaign around the 11-hour mark and that's it? I would've beaten it faster if I was allowed to do it my way. They should've at least added co-op for the campaign, so we could see how other players solve puzzles. Although that's not good enough for me, I prefer PvP or exclusive content for co-op. The developers heavily advertised the ability to play as Zelda, which is nothing more than a gimmick that gets old fast. How about they spend time actually improving the performance, instead of coming up with gimmicks. It's unacceptable that this indie quality game has the same price tag as something like RDR2 or TLOU2, even if I hate the latter moreso than this game. This is the equivalent of a McDonald's cheeseburger being priced the same as a truffle, it's pathetic. I don't recommend this game at all. ● P.S. Metacritic, I have the right to express my opinion. Was the censored word a problem? Laura Branigan did a song about glass and look up the most popular song of Johnny Hates Jazz. That was the censored word, a Rolling Stones song. Not a bad word.",0.0,ENGLISH
I only wish they would have made a better menu for echoe selection and an option to change language on the physical version. The menu to wich I am refering is still better than Totk by a very slight margin. Everything else was awsome and smooth. Frames and visuals were good and gameplay was simply fun.,0.8999999999999999,ENGLISH

"With all the talk that Astro Bot has this innovative gameplay, Nintendo simply said 'hey, hold my beer'.  This latest Zelda installment was announced a couple of months ago out of nowhere, and released a couple of days ago. It is shaping up to be one of the best Zelda installment in recent memory and that's ahigh praise after the BOTW duology. Its innovation is simple: let you play as Zelda, pure and simple. The copy ability is a brilliant way to introduce a new way of play alongside the usual Zelda tropes. The Switch may be on its last year and if this is one of its last hurrah then it's a great way to exit one of Nintendo's most prolific console era in recent memory.",0.8999999999999999,ENGLISH

"Really wanted to like this one. I love BOTW and TOTK. But this is the worst 2D Zelda game by far. The Echo mechanic feels like something the devs thought about for a few hours and then shipped. It’s incredibly underbaked, puzzles are too easy, combat is laughably bad, and the UI is disastrous. The world is cool tho.",0.3,ENGLISH

"Poor performance. The stuttering is really annoying. Even Nintendo's own games don't run smoothly anymore. They don't realize that the hardware is outdated. Instead they bring out the same old Switch with a new design. It's unplayable. The Switch is dead. Deal with it. I would wait for the new console and hope that it can be played with better performance. The game has some good ideas, but it's boring. Zelda's object creation is imprecise. It often spawns to the left or right, no control in it. The chests contains useless stuff and the sword mode shows that the concept isn't fully developed yet. I would wait for the next Zelda game. I would rate it higher if the game ran smoothly. It's no fun playing with these performance issues.",0.3,ENGLISH

I gave it a fair shot but there is very little difficulty in anything, be it the puzzles or moment-to-moment gameplay, which doesn’t have to be an issue if the game is still engaging but I struggled to find any reason to continue. I like the concept and love that Zelda finally got her own game but frankly it bores me, and not because it’s a slower paced strategy game but because everything I encountered could be figured out in a few moments, and the things that couldn’t were often tedious.
