"If you love Victoria 3 and civilization, then this is the game for you. It’s unique in its own take of the civilization genre, and thrives in its own brilliance. However, optimization and some core mechanics like nukes or advanced diplomatic features let down this game’s potential. Not to mention the horrible text and UI, it can be a game killer if your anything like me. A year of updates would make this game easily a 9/10, so for anyone wondering if you should get this game, wait until a sale. By then it will be worth playing.",0.07

"I hate how people who prefer a more action-oriented game, ruin a game with bad ratings.  This is a large brain game, a lot is going on and it is beautiful and extremely well crafted.  I cannot wait for them to get going, update the military aspect, and add more flavor to the game.  If you actually enjoy managing a supply chain and nurturing a population so it exponentially grows into a powerhouse, then this game is for you",0.1

"Ara is not a normal civ. It's more like a micro-managed city builder where instead of controlling a city, remember the Caesar series, we manage an empire. Here the important thing is not wars or religion, which have a certain importance, but rather that the game is won by prestige achieved by the well-being of citizens by supplying their pyramid of needs. It is true that war and religion influence but they play a secondary role. It is a 4X, but victory is better achieved by the pen than by the sword. I repeat, it is not a civ. His style is a mix of Humankind with Anno management. Positive point, anyone who likes these games of numbers and opening and closing tabs will be in their element. Negative point, depending on how you look at it, the very steep learning curve. I like difficult games so I give it a nine.",0.09
