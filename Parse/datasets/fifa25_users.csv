"Every year EA invests a lot of money in development and it shows. This year's FC 25 is not a bad game. There is some progression from FC 24. What **** is defacto the same menu as last year. The stadium decoration would deserve a more diverse approach. Hilarious Rush mode and hilarious tactics setup, plus Rush weaves its way into the other modes. Occasional minor bugs will hopefully be resolved in future updates. I definitely recommend playing the game and trying out all the modes, especially Rush. It's hilarious fun and a great replacement for Volta. ****",0.8

This is the exact same game as 24. I am so done with this game. No more. I’m gonna play something different than football,0.0
"There is not much to write home about for this year's installment of FC. That is not an exciting way to do business for EA, but their incremental improvements in gameplay, career mode, and the brand new rush mode make FC 25 a solid sports title.",0.6
"Great game, love the graphics, sound and game play.  Very fun.  Also love the new rush mode. What a great addition to the franchise.",1.0
Rush is awesome! Playing 4v4 gives me more opportunities and is more action-packed than 11v11. So stoked about the gameplay innovations in FC25!,1.0

"Inconsistent gameplay, cpu controlled players unpredictable. The new tactical setup very limiting compared to previous games, making it difficult to play creatively.",0.0
"One word unplayable ,they need to make a study about how this game keeps getting worse year after another.",0.1
"Ray tracing do change stuff, but fix the trophy reflection It has been basic cube map since like FIFA 15? FCIQ is... Useless when you just want to play.",0.8
"This is exactly the same exact game as last year. I’m sick of EA and its trash football game. No more, I am so done with this.",0.1
"If this game was free-to-play, it would be rated 4-5. But the developers have become completely brazen and sell you a patch to an outdated, unrealistic game for huge amounts of money, and then force you to spend your money again over the course of a year to buy cheat cards (pay-to-win). Have you noticed that nobody is interested in FC as a football simulator? This game has completely turned into a casino. Everyone is only interested in opening packs and evaluating players. I feel very sorry for the people who spend a huge amount of time, nerves and money on this ""game"", and Electronicarts simply resets the composition at the end of the year, releasing a patch at full price. This is a scam.",0.0
"Dou nota 4 para FC25, pois apesar de algumas boas mudanças nos replays, o jogo parece mais uma DLC. Jogo offline e gostei de explorar ângulos e modos especiais de replay, mas ainda sinto falta de lances essenciais, como os chutes a gol em que o goleiro espalma a bola para dentro do campo. Não só as bolas que vão para fora, mas principalmente aquelas que permanecem em jogo, muitas vezes resultando em momentos emocionantes e decisivos, que acabam sendo descartados. Esses replays são fundamentais para capturar lances de momentos-chave. Além disso, sinto falta dos replays de dribles, que foram removidos após o FIFA 17.A física das camisas está exagerada e o vento precisa de ajustes, pois gera bugs. A jogabilidade, de modo geral, é decepcionante: as animações parecem limitadas e pouco realistas, com movimentos estranhos, como condução de bola pouco natural e recepções inconsistentes. Às vezes, a bola parece grudada no pé do jogador, comprometendo a fluidez e o realismo das jogadas. O modo Rush é dispensável e ainda não testei o modo carreira. FC25 tem bons gráficos e uma ambientação legal, mas falta uma evolução na jogabilidade.A EA perdeu uma grande oportunidade de entregar um excelente jogo de futebol, sendo preguiçosa nas melhorias. Agora, está pagando o preço com as más avaliações que o jogo tem recebido até o momento.",0.4
Ultimate team is a disease and EA makes minor adjustments or rehashes game dynamics with a different name to get stupid people to spend money on packs…do yourself a favour and go buy Astro Bot instead,0.0
"Sempre la stessa roba, niente di nuovo , come al solito, spacciano questa ia come innovazione ma non è niente, i giocatori si muovono in modo totalmente irreale, le statistiche dei giocatori come al solito non hanno valore, servono soltanto a rendere piú bella la carta. In sostanza risparmiatoristi 70 euro",0.0

"The game has not changed. Same finishing, dribbling, defending, goal scoring and unrealistic arcade-like gameplay. EA tweaks few minor things and adds few features or renames a game mode and then sells it full price and even worse, EA asks you to spend time and money to build your team in Ultimate. I am so disappointed by this Casino style of football games.",0.0
"Ah, FC25—proof that sometimes sequels actually do get better, though in this case, it's like saying the headache is a little less throbbing this time around. Admittedly, my first couple of hours were a festival of frustration, and I came dangerously close to testing the aerodynamics of my controller. But then I discovered the ""simulation setting,"" which might as well be called the ""save your sanity"" button. It turns the game from a brutal test of patience into something actually playable—especially for the ""less talented"" folks like me who just want to kick back and enjoy career mode without breaking a sweat... or a **** my surprise, I even found myself *enjoying* the gameplay again. I know, shocking, right? Especially when facing the AI, which still behaves like it's got the ball fused to its feet. But hey, it's progress. And finally—finally—career mode got some well-deserved attention after being ignored for what feels like a century. It’s a noticeable improvement, though don’t expect it to suddenly be perfect. The AI still loves to turn into a superhuman ball magnet right after you score, and the new ""tactical foul"" system? Well, let’s just say you'll see more yellow than a traffic light on your way to work.Still, FC25 is undeniably a step up from FC24. Sure, it's not perfect, but it's like that friend who finally gets their act together—still a bit rough around the edges, but at least they’re trying. And for that, I’ll take it.",0.8
"This is what happens when you continue building on foundations laid since FIFA 08. No true ""nextgen"" football game has been released since the beginning of the ps3/360 gen of consoles. Pathetic.",0.0
"The game itself is not Bad, but not good, I would put Average, it has beautiful graphics and more dynamics,but it's still the same Always, the fact Absurd price and the game doesn't There is nothing different from the previous one, making the purchase unnecessary. The game should focus on Bring news, but he Failure in this aspect",0.6
"I was not expecting many changes, to be honest. But, I did genuinely enjoy FC24 and the changes they did make for 25 all are for the better. Career Mode is actually enjoyable now, and the gameplay truly does feel different. Obviously, the main issue is still the fact that EA wants you to spend money even after buying the game, but other than that, I think it's an amazing game and probably one of the best FIFA / FC editions ever.",0.8999999999999999
