review,score
"Tried this game because of hype, had no experience with DnD or similar RPG’s. And for a guy like me there was way too little tutorial. I was still figuring out basic combat mechanics 30 h in, and spent a lot of time googling the list of 40 abilities presented every time you level up. But really cool how side quests and main story seemlessly blend. Stuff that seem random at first turn out to be hugely significant to the plot. Overall I had a cozy time planning combat and experiencing the sort of 80’s fantasy art style. There’s been a lot of praise for how big the game is, but I feel most of my time was spent in menus, wish it was story progression instead. The game’s also been praised for roll playing possibilities, but I think I would’ve needed a more anonymous main character without pre determined face reactions etc to get into it. Lastly, big fights are usually puzzle based and I had fun with that, but there was a lot of trial and error which was a slog because of long loading times. I was under the impression you could solve the puzzles based on your characters unique skillset, but most of the time there’s a set way you should be doing things. It’s probably different for more experienced DnD players who can break the game a bit to progress, but with lacking knowledge that was hard to do intuitively.",0.07

"Can't use the Adamantine Forge a second time because of a bug. Can't access the crucible, can't interact with it, nothing...Serious trash game.",0.01
"Unplayable on console. Seems like a good game, with challenging combat. But the controls on console are an unmitigated disaster, and there is no mouse and keyboard support. This is how not to port a PC game. The controls use clunky radials with not enough space for a character's skills meaning you end up with a cluttered mess which is awkward to navigate and makes the game very frustrating. I had to sell the physical edition I'd purchased get it on PC instead and get the mod to fix the bad camera with 3rd person camera and zoom out.",0.01
"Baldur's Gniot 3.Tytuł powiela wszystkie błędy poprzednich produkcji Larian Studios i jeszcze dokłada kolejne, wynikające z implementacji mechaniki D&amp;D. Ilość nieudanych ruchów, ciosów, zaklęć, podobnie jak mnogość bugów, glitchy i niedoróbek jest ekstremalnie **** staje się festiwalem wielokrotnego wczytywania save'ów, bo znów coś poszło nie tak. Jedyne punkty jakie przyznaję są za fabułę i styl, gdyż te są na najwyższym poziomie.Menu jest kompletnie zawalone - niefunkcjonalne, nieresponsywne, co dziwi, bo w serii Divinity było pod tym względem dobrze, jak na konsolę.

"simplesmente o melhor jogo que eu já joguei. Jogo que tem sua história baseado no rpg D&amp;D onde tudo é recompensador, seja sua historia onde vc pode moldar relacionamento de acordo com sua personalidade e a do participante da ""party"" com relacionamentos bem construídos. Sua exploração não deixa a desejar onde não há vontade de deixar de explorar por que a todo momento você é recompensado seja com pontos de afeto ou um novo sett de armaduras ou espadas diferentes que de fato irão mudar sua gameplay deixando ela mais ""fácil"" mesmo sendo um jogo desafiador. Você pode ser o que o jogo te disponibiliza sendo um orc guerreiro e mago ou outras variações. Seus gráficos que podem não ser um primor para um jogo desse estilo esta muito bonito mas poderiam caprichar na optimização já que o jogo pode ser um pouco travado dependendo da situação. Seu combate simplesmente é perfeito e não cansa em momento nenhum pelo fato de infinitas variações e possibilidades, se o combate for uma preocupação sua, deveria ignora-la pois é um combate perfeito e balanceado. O jogo conta com suas em media 70 horas ou 100 mas por incrível que pareça ela te vicia de um jeito que você nunca viu onde nenhum momento vc se sente cansado ou coisa do tipo Simplesmente uma das maiores obras de artes que uma empresa já fez ressuscitando o gênero mais uma vez e dessa vez ganhando um premio gigante como o goty simplesmente uma das maiores obras de artes de todos os tempos, lê apresento Baldurs Gate 3.",0.1

One of the best games and best multi-player games I have ever played. Only real issues were some framerate problems and minor bugs that required restarting the game.,0.08
"Too long, too complicated systems, inventory is hours of wasted time, overly complicated way to finish the game so I decided to quit in the lower city after spending too many hours exploring around. Wish I had my time back.",0.06
Its just not for me.personally i dont like d&amp;d games and all that stuff. This game has a very spesific fan base. Also its turn based and beside persona 3i hate turn based games,0.05
"One of the best game that I played yet. Maybe the best. What a unique experience. How is it possible that when you finish a game twice, it can feel completely different both times ? I thought we wouldn't see such a high quality RPG game for a long time after Disco Elysium, but now we have Baldur's Gate 3. Larian Studios has captured a cinematic narrative that is difficult to see in such a CRPG game. MASTERPİECE 10/11 !",0.1
Absolute masterpiece and deserved GOTY! The attention and love to every detail makes it outstandingly amazing and Larian deserves all the praise for that.,0.1
The tempo of the battle is too slow. The difficulty is too high. The characters are not appealing. The story is boring.,0.0
"The game is huge, they could sell the game in three parts, but they decided to put them into one single game, what a great gaming company! I have never played DnD before, and I was a big fan of quick action RPG game, but BG3 make me feel turn-by-turn game could be exciting and breathtaking as well!   My complains are reloading a save taking quite a while, and it crashed more than ten times on PS5 during my 300 hours play.   BUT all of these are forgivable for its fun game play and rich story telling :)",0.1

"One of the worst and most boring games I've ever played.I don't know anything about tabletop games or dungeons and dragons and I never liked turn based games. The only reason I wanted to play this game was from hearing about it so much, so much praise, and so many awards and people talking about it, how it's called one of the best games ever and how it's 96 rated on metacritic. I also played hundreds of games and I love any game that gives you freedom of choice and multiple approaches and consequences to your actions and different endings...I've played about 3 hours Baldur's Gate 3 and then I uninstalled. I'll explain why I think it's one of the worst games I've played:1- The Combat: This is the main and biggest reason why I absolutely hated the game, so you walk around freely in the game like any rpg and encounter quests and characters and chests and whatnot, but then whenever you encounter enemies the entire world literally pauses around you and it becomes a 1999 tabletop game that some nerdy kids in some basement play, it actually turns into Raid Shadow Legends lmao, it's actually hilarious that so many people like it, I guess stupidity knows no limits when it comes to the video game industry. And so it basically kills any momentum and the combat becomes this dice game where you click on an enemy and then your character attacks them and it either misses or hits, so you're not playing the game using your skills or your moves, it's just a dice game. This game is where I vowed to never ever buy or download games based on reputation and reviews, I have to watch a long playthrough in order to decide to get it or not.2- Everything All At Once: One of the other reasons why I uninstalled the game and stopped playing is because of how much convoluted stuff is in the game from the very start, like 30 different attacks or items in one character, this with 2 turns and it turns this to that for 10 turns and this attack isn't actually an attack and this move makes you hide and that move is a flame that heals and that move is some spell that turns enemies into jelly or makes them scared... It's just soooo much that I went ""what the f**k is going in, what's all of this s**t?!"". I know some games doesn't hold your hand but this is just a horrible terrible game that basically excepts you to be a Baldur's Gate player for 20 years and also have played the tabletop games, it's insanely dreadful for new players and I'm actually shocked that so many people new to the game with the IQ of 2 managed to like the game so much.3- The Story From The Start Is Not Interesting: The game starts with tentacle monsters and dragons and multiple race creatures and different worlds and so many things happening at once that I just literally lost interest from the start. The beginning **** or a in my opinion is the most important part to me, If from the start you're bored and uninteresting because of how much stuff is happening it's a bad game/movie. Games should have a clear beginning where you build up to things and slowly learn what this and that is, this game feels like you're dropped in the third act **** where you're already unlocked it all and so much story already happened, it doesn't feel like a new game that you start.",0.0
"Best game ever, only game to respect the intelligence of players. No other games do this.",0.1
One of the greatest RPGs and Strategy games of all time. The attention to detail and immense choice is simply staggering. Borderline perfect game.,0.1
Baldur's gate 3 is a masterpiece. You can litteraly do anything in this game like speak with dead bodies or animals and even romance your companions ! Also the dialogues are very detailed and important for the rest of your playthrough. There are so many options that one campaign might be enough and you will probably play the game with the Dark Urge origin character that offers an additionnal plot twist and a deep backstory. Hope you will enjoy the game as much as I did !,0.1
"Poor gameplay, too much sexuality in game. Optimization is poor. Definitely not recommending.",0.0
"Almost perfect game! Only issues are in technical sphere (optimization, broken animations)",0.09
Clearly one of the best games I've played. An incredible rich world to interact with. Amazing atmosphere that made me fall in love instantly. Great depth in combat and then the story. Can't wait for the next game by Larian.,0.1
"This is what an RPG should look like... what a real video game should look like. The strength of his writing is when, right in the middle of the game, you already want to do it again to find out what could happen with other choices.",0.1
"The PR campaign and press reviews are way above actual reality. It is an overall good game which builds on the current D&amp;D ruleset and the legacy of the previous Baldur's Gate title and general Bioware RPGs. The interface is clunky, and the combat and gameplay is sometimes too. The character faces and movements are not top notch. Woke elements are ruining the character creation to the point of being unbearable. 5 or 7 face options are given but for some reason the same amount of dangling genitalia was deemed more important. Writing of characters is sometimes very shallow, with the language depth of a pre-teen (Barbarian). Multiplayer is very enjoyable though again, junky in terms of dialogue. Totally worth playing, but nowhere close in terms of quality to what the press PR pushes it to be.",0.04

Greatest most incredible game ever!!!!!!! The only games that rival it! Are Red Dead Redemption 2 and The legend of Zelda tears of the Kingdom. Plays amazing on PS5!,0.1
"While I don't usually like to point out that the game is overhyped, I'd definitely use the term here. The gameplay is very sloggish, Rng-heavy and simply boring. I loved BG1 and 2, and your experience here will be greatly different. It was not the sequel I wanted, unfortunately. I appreciate the voice-over and the amount of dialogue, but it doesn't have much else going for me personally. Deeply disappointed.",0.07

I don’t understand the hype on this “mobile game” put on PS5! So boring to play! Only gave 2 points for the graphics. Incredible how people nowadays don’t know how to play  really good games! Not fun at all! Don’t waist your time and money on this BS game!,0.02
"Usually such long and complex games are very invested games and this is one of the features that make a game a winning game in almost every respect, I personally have never connected to role-playing games of this type CRPGs but I received a recommendation to play this one, and I can say that it is a crazy and amazing gaming experience that I have not encountered before  , it's about an unprecedented narrative and gameplay and story, the game opens up a genre for me that I haven't played in before, and in my opinion the impact on such games in the gaming world is enormous.",0.1
"I've never played Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Baldur's Gate or any CRPG ever in my life, but I'm just gonna say it straight away; this game is **** nuts! From the nearly endless amount of gameplay options, to the absolute freedom of choice, constant decisions that matter and different outcomes, unparalleled depth, variety and content, Baldur's Gate 3 is without a doubt, the ultimate RPG of all time, hands **** story of the game, however, is divided into 3 **** 1 is probably the best and most well-designed videogame experience I've ever had, 40 hours worth of **** 2 is half the lenght of the other 2 acts and more linear, but it's a refreshing change of pace and a great continuation of the first **** 3 is the culmination of the entire story and it's very similar to the first act, albeit slightly less polished, but it's incredible nonetheless.Overall, the story is very interesting and well-written, although it relies heavily on side-stories like many other **** characters are some of the best I've seen in an RPG, **** visuals and the music are amazing as well, even though the visuals didn't particularly impress me.Unfortunately, the game suffers from some minor technical issues at times, like pop-ins and input lag, but it's not a big deal at all.Pros:+ Excellent gameplay+ RPG elements and depth+ Variety and content+ Intriguing story+ Wonderful characters+ Beautiful music and visualsCons:- Minor technical issuesNarrative: 9/10Gameplay: 10/10Content: 10/10Characters: 10/10Music: 9/10Graphics/Audio: 9/10Final Rating: 10/10- Masterpiece -At the end of the day, I'm thankful at Larian Studios for dedicating mind and soul to create such a passionately crafted work of art in every single way. The developers really cared about this game and it shows; Baldur's Gate 3 is the kind of videogame other studios should look up to, and it also managed to do the impossible; I can't even believe that I'm saying this... but it might even be my new favorite videogame of all time at this **** I recommend it?:Must-play for RPG fans and highly recommended for everyone else too.",0.1

"Disappointing. I so badly want to like this game: I love D&amp;D, I love RPGs where your choices have big impacts, I love games where your party has growth. But this game is a huge miss. I've reached the end of the game and I've yet to play for an hour without experiencing a bug that was at best extremely frustrating and at worst (and frequently) game breaking. The pacing is horrible. There's an immediate sense of urgency in the main quest but you're also given a huge amount of side quests immediately, some of which are time sensitive. Side treks linger on for far longer than feels natural. And then, in Act2, the game suddenly becomes incredibly linear with only two point of significant interest. It feels rushed, feels sloppy, feels like it was in ""early access"" for too **** writing is boring. It's as if someone read a few D&amp;D rule books and said ""Yes I want to cram all of this in here.""The companions are uninspired and templated. Here is all origin companions: ""I was very powerful, but the bug in my head has me at level 1. I am a slave to XYZ, my quest is to secure my freedom from them. Along the way you can make the binary choice of me being a good guy or a bad guy.""The game gives you access to all the creative tools of D&amp;D, but punishes out of the box solutions and forces you into a linear or binary choice which is sometimes not even hinted at. For example (keeping it vague for spoilers), there was an encounter where an NPC was trapped on a cart full of explosive oil with a flammable trail of liquid leading to him and some hostile NPCs set the liquid on fire. I threw water at the fire around the cart, it exploded and he died. Reload. I run up and help/talk to him, it exploded and he died. Reload. I quickly kill all enemies in one round, it exploded and he died. Reload. I throw water on the flammable liquid trail before the encounter starts. Fire doesn't reach him! ...until the second round where the other half of the trail randomly catches fire with no interaction from any characters. Reload. I use a telekinesis spell to move the captive NPC to safety, he randomly teleports back to the location he was in but now he's prone and hostile. Reload. Googled a solution. Apparently you have to shoot the chair he's sitting on? Are you serious? Nothing ever indicated that solution, and any of the previous solutions should have worked, but this game won't allow creative thinking. There are numerous examples of instances where you're able to withhold info from NPCs, but then they suddenly have the info as if you told them anyway because the story can't continue if they don't know it. Don't give me the option to make these choices if you don't actually have a continuation for them. Terrible planning. Near infinite glitches, bugs, and visual clipping **** UI/UX leaves a lot to be desired. Sorting your inventory is mess. Tutorial pop ups appear and cover up important info but can't be dismissed until you leave the current screen you're trying to interact with. Objective indicators often lead you in the wrong direction if you enter another area. Dye color names are sometimes misleading. Random NPCs will prevent you from looting something that should be of no concern to them or should be rightfully yours to access. The learning curve for the sloppy combat mechanics is frustrating. Dashing really confuses the games logic often throwing a ""can't reach this target"" when you in fact can, and you just need to select the area next to it first.This game is truly a mess and undeserving of the praise it receives. A real shame because it could have been a 10/10 if Larian actually put the effort into it, but I suppose the bar for GOTY is low these days and easy profit is tempting. Seriously a shame.",0.0

"I usually don't like turned based games and find them sometimes boring but then I played BG3 and found it one of my favorite game to play. The stories is good, chareters well written and combat for some reason just feels right with a bit of annoying with dice rolls and the way you can forge how the story plays out is greate (I consider going for power, make you feel like a God in the game) but other then that a greate game I can see why BG3 won GOTY",0.1

"Graphics, story, characters, game play, world design are all great.  Inventory management is very time consuming and tedious.  I ended up quitting out of frustration because the game freezes when using the chest at camp to manage inventory.  Spend too much time in that chest for the game to be freezing on me every other time I'm trying to do something.  Too bad because I was enjoying the game otherwise.  Big improvement over Divinity Sin 2 on Switch.",0.07
"Game is pretty good,most of the bug have been ironed out now,so I had a smooth experience on ps5,except of some minor issues.Act1  reminded of DOS2 a bit,which I wasn't a big fan of,but reaching Act2 I was properly hooked.Truth be told,I was expecting a more modern battle system,real time with pause would be great like BG2 or Dragon Age Origins,although it's working nice as it is,but it's nothing groundbreaking.Story is good and characters are great,except the fact that everyone for some reason want to f@@k me,even when I don't pursue the issue.I mean yes,I know,my necromancer is handsome but **** ruins the sense of companionship.Well,it's hard to ignore the hard work making this game,the scope and the almost endless possibilities approaching each situation.Much deserved goty.",0.09

"Combat, in particular, is a major letdown. While previous entries in the series offered engaging real-time battles that required quick thinking and strategic planning, Baldur's Gate 3 opts for a turn-based system that feels sluggish and cumbersome.

ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER MADE. I STARTED WITH HUGE HATE BUT AFTER 5-6 HOURS THAT HATE TURNED INTO HUGE LOVE,0.1
"While a bit of a slow burn kind of game, Baldur's Gate 3 is a game that is replayable multiple times over, and is a faithful love letter to D&amp;D fans. The character creator is very deep. The characters are very dynamic with how they develop. The story is very intricately written, full of hidden lore that helps add to the experience. Combat seems simple at first, but has more depth than it lets on. A worthy winner for game of the year, and considering Larian is an underdog studio, one that doesn't nickel and dime players, and one that is working very hard to fix any issues that arises, they are to be commended for their efforts with making an experience players will remember for years to come.",0.1

I start the game and the cut scenes had no sound, only the ship, and other things. Nobody was talking. The game is slow. Walking 20 meters is 6-7 rounds... of course the game is very long... The map is the worst i ever saw in games... i was walking around and around.... My character died after stepped in a small amount of ember... This game is the lowest of lows... A romance simulator.... with useless gore... it was not good and pointless. Everything was gore and nothing was looking good. Alan Wake 2 was really good, did the horror, the gore in a different way than any other game... Yet it does not have any nudes, and its only on Epic so people start hating it while they didn't even tried it out. I was shocked about why only epic so i started searching. The cost of the game was 80 mil... Epic founded it... Its that easy. If no epic = no Alan Wake 2. That game made me fell in love with the Remedy Universe. And Alan Wake 2 is the GOTY for 2023.",0.0

I've watched endless 'how to' videos on YouTube and I changed difficulty to Explorer but every few yards it feels like I wander into some group combat and my squad gets slayed. I HATE the limited movement, the awful camera angle, the whole turn based thing. WHY is there so much combat on Explorer mode?? WHY can't I have some time to look around and settle in before having to deal with the combat. I can't say that it's a bad game - I haven't played long enough to have anything to say about the story or characters though it does look pretty. I literally turn it on, cover ground for 3-4 minutes, hit the next combat, get very rapidly wiped out, reload several times trying different approaches, trying to figure out what I should be doing, quit in frustration.

"BG3: The biggest surprise for me in YEARS. I knew nothing about this game before it came out. The only reason I heard about it is because it was getting such positive buzz, and it was all deserved. I’ve spent hundreds of hours in this immersive story. From the characters, to the story, to the exploration, this game blows every other RPG out of the water. This game released around the same time as Starfield and it made me realize how boring Starfield is and made me forget about playing it. You can choose from so many different classes and every little decision you make matters. This is honestly probably the game of the generation, and Larian keeps improving it constantly. Thank you so much Larian! We don’t deserve you.",0.1

PS5版を買いました。最初なんだかわかりませんでしたがやっていくうちにシステムを理解して仲間のキャラクタの想いを汲み取る様な選択肢が多数あり、また利害関係や自分で未来を選んでいく様な感覚はここゲームでしか味わえない部分かと思いました。攻略を見ずに130時間くらいでクリアしましたが非常に面白かったです。ドラマを見ている様な感じというかそのくらい人間模様に面白さがあります。戦闘は後半は1時間コースですが、細かいモーションも作り込まれており俯瞰していると援軍の行動とかに癒されます。こんなゲームもうできないんだろうなと思う大作。,0.1

"I love Dungeons &amp; Dragons, However, this game felt, boring and slow. I'm used to play, turn based games, but this one was boring. Any other game such as Shadowrun: Dragonfall is just so exciting to play. I played Baldur's Gate 3 for an hour and nothing happened. I was being bored the whole time. The cut scenes are built up on cliche. For example: A plane, that's been going down with many explosions, what you escape just in time, where you land in the unknown.... I'm seeing the same problem here, with Overwatch 2. The Game doesn't show you, nor tell you anything. This loses the ""fun"" part of the game. I was lost many times, and because of this bad map design, I was walking around the map clueless. The Game is full of gore, and pornographic scenes... This is why people in the 80' said that Dungeons &amp; Dragons is bad for the children. And this is why the game is famous. This game robbed Alan Wake 2 from the Game Of The Year Award. Alan Wake 2 is this years, best game. A game with a dark tone, with beautiful graphics, and with a brilliant narrative. And with 0 pornographic scenes! This Game, Baldur's Gate 3 is an over hyped Ren'Py Visual Novel Game. Do me a favour, and play Alan Wake 2, and see what this ""game"" robbed.",0.0

"The impact of Baldur's Gate on my gaming experience has been profound, altering my perspective in ways I never anticipated. It has transformed my preferences, showcasing a level of depth in choices, dialogues, and decisions that I had never encountered before. With over 100 hours invested in this masterpiece, I can confidently say that I've never witnessed anything comparable. The precision of the choices presented is awe-inspiring, leaving me in a state of perpetual astonishment. I find myself reluctant for the game to conclude, dreading the return to a world saturated with uninspiring titles like Diablo 4 and Ubisoft games, which pale in comparison.Larian, thank you. My attachment to this game is profound, and I intend to carry it with me beyond the realms of gaming. Elden Ring and BG3 stand as the transformative pillars in my gaming journey. The ability to form emotional connections with characters, remember NPCs, and genuinely care about every word, place, and detail is a testament to the unparalleled craftsmanship of this game. In short, words fall short to express my gratitude for the experience you've bestowed upon ****'ve irreversibly influenced the gaming industry, setting a standard that rejects mediocre and hollow creations. I cherish the profound impact you've had on my gaming life, and for that, I extend my heartfelt thanks.",0.1
"With the reviews, I thought 'no matter this type of game isn't my thing, it seems to be for everyone!'. Dear lord, no! I'm not cool by any means but lordy, this is top tier nerdy stuff. Also, VERY time consuming....expect to spend hours and still be pretty much where you were when you first logged in that day. I think with some insane level of actually caring about what's going on and the results of your actions, it is maybe good? I couldn't give a monkeys and so I just tried to plough through **** even then it all took ages. No idea why the big love but if you hated it like me, you're not alone! Hope that makes you feel a tad better about wasting your hard earned money.",0.03
"I really tried to try a new game. This game seemed to be loved by a particular niche. Having paid full price off the hype I’d recommend against playing it. Just watch it online if you want the story. Cause the gameplay **** for me and is so convoluted and confusing. The movement is extremely slow throughout the map which was a problem for me even in Pokémon and other similar games but the story makes up for it. I’m also pissed cause a glitch cost me a weapon I spent so long to find and my squad was weaker in every single fight after. I liked the story so far but it all seems consequential. If you’re into this type of game or DnD you’ll love it. For me, I got to the end of act 2 and put it down I hate this game. It frustrated me throughout and the story feels inconsequential. This game gets overwhelming positivity for some reason idk. For me, it **** ****. For someone else, this might be the best game ever cause they enjoy these type of things. Also it’s very easy to make fake metacritic accounrs and bot spam boost reviews. I’m not saying that they’re doing that just that it is. Keep that in mind before you buy off the hype. For reference I enjoyed cyberpunk more. Even Jedi survivor. Its just not my thing and the grind and main fun parts of the game **** to me. It seems like a pointless investment of mashing buttons that makes me question life.  All while letting 90% of the story bore me. In the end I tried out a game randomly and I hated it but I loved the Witcher 3 when I did that. So whatever do you",0.01

"A turn-based RPG where your choices actually matter. I enjoyed the freedom of how you approach situations in the game and how your early game decisions can affect late game.

"I hated this game when I first played it because I didn’t have a clue where I was going or what I needed to do. However, after I got familiarized with the game, did some side content and leveled up my characters, I had a lot of fun. The amount of choice u have in this game is insane - you can be a good person (like I did) or not, perhaps even choosing the Dark Urge. Combat can be a little confusing at the start because there isn’t really a tutorial. The game doesn’t say ‘this is this’ etc, but the way the game makes D and D so much more simpler means there’s not much to get confused with here, except maybe choosing abilities and classes. My only other issue with combat is that it can be really really hard. Initially I didn’t do loads of side content, only a necessary amount to get me past a fight I was struggling with. But this game is divided into acts, and that means that once u enter a new large area, the only way to go back to where u were before is loading an older save, and if u don’t wanna do that because u have progressed the game quite a lot since that point then ur screwed and all u can do is turn the difficulty down. That just feels like a huge oversight for me. Also with certain quests I had to rely on YouTube a fair bit to know what to do as it’s a little cryptic at times. However apart from these points, everything else is pretty much perfect. The combat is fun. The acting is amazing. The characters are mostly interesting. Choosing your path as you progress is something I wish more games did, and it’s done so well here. It deserved GOTY because it did so many things great that other games don’t and felt like a completely new experience. You just have to be patient and give this game a try for yourself. Too many games nowadays just shove microtransactions in your face, but not BG3. You get what you paid for, and you never get asked ‘buy the latest skin for only £60’ like Overwatch 2 or Call of Duty. Overall a great experience that should show other developers that the audience doesn’t want a digital shopping simulator with a mediocre, half baked game on the side. You should try BG3 but not EVERYONE is gonna like it because it’s a turn-based game. However, it might just surprise you, like it surprised me.",0.08
"Great story, nice graphics, but the combat is sloooooowww. Add to that, that the chance of missing a hit doesn't represent the percentages (I've experienced that you can easily miss at 99% hit chance, 3 times in a row), which doesn't make the combat fun or tactical. There are way better alternatives than random (incorrect) results after the role of the dice. I often reload out of frustration, which takes rediculously long on top of that. Furthermore, I found out that I've missed several quests since for some quests, there are no quest indicators on the map, while the quest menu is an unorganized mess (at least on the ps5). Actually, the whole menu structure is quite unorganized and rather illogical. Also,why does it have so many different spells, doing more or less the same, not even providing a particular and clear tactical advantage in battle, as well as limited spell slots and a limited spellbook? More focus would be better (Less is more).",0.06

"Not typically my kind of game considering the turn-based combat and DnD atmosphere but wow was I blown away! You can tell the developers really cared about the finished product and man did they deliver. Easy to pick up, difficult to master with a lot going on with party management/stats/lore etc. etc. but I felt the game did a good job of not overwhelming the player at the beginning and easing into things. I did get Skyrim syndrome initially, restarting a few times after 5-10 hr runs before I was satisfied with a character I had created. Game has an insane amount of replay value as you can have completely different experiences each playthru considering the character you made and the choices and actions you decide to take throughout.",0.1

"BG3 is a special game. I initially didn’t love the combat because it was the first game with this type of combat that I had played. As I progressed through the game it became for fun. I also watched some videos on YouTube on how to properly build my character. This game its probably the best game when it comes to role playing in the fantasy genre. I have many other build ideas. I am writing this review after finishing the game. I did every quest I came across, but I’m sure I missed some things. Regardless my first play through on normal difficulty was at about 98 hours. It’s a long game, but if you enjoy RPGs it’s absolutely worth the money. The reviews for this game are absolutely warranted. It isn’t for everyone, mostly because of the combat, but once you figure it out it’s an amazing experience. Lastly, the replay value on this game is amazing. Yes you can have tons of different builds, but the dialogue choices are probably the best I’ve seen in a game. Next play through I will probably be a bad guy. I’m looking forward to seeing how much the game changes.",0.1

Turn base for the most part is well done in the game and I genuinely encourage ppl to give it a chance if the gameplay being turn based is what puts you off as It is actually fun especially late game when you hit the cap and unlock everything but overall this is a great game and my new favorite of 2023",0.09
"The first two Acts was great but the problem was Act 3 the companions stopped following me or they followed after 1 minute passed away very often, to do interactions with people or things took very long loading circles ,switching characters took 30seconds to 1 Minute loading. The Horde of enemies in the near of the end of the game was frustrating it took me 10 min to walk characters away from the battle because they kept rolling inspiration cubes even though all enemies was dead but the game showed two unconsciuos enemies but the battle ended . the last areas of the game was bad designed and the endboss area and fight was not fair designed. The Game crashed 15-20 times reinstalling didnt fixed it the only way was closing internet connection from the PlayStation **** Camera in the game is not the yellow from the egg. The story was really good but the endboss destroyed it for me a bit and the lagging of the team mates in Act3. i forgot the biggest **** was in the near endgame was a battle of horde of enemies and to wait every people taking there turn was sooo a waste of time",0.06

"One of the best RPGs I’ve ever played, and by far the best since The Witcher 3. The level of detail, from graphics to mechanics, is astounding. Not only does it reassert the relevance of turn based combat, but in so many ways it’s better than most real time action games. You can speak with almost any NPC in the world - and there are many - and they will perform not just great voice acting, but beautifully expressive motion captures. The world and characters are interesting, and there is infinite replayability. The way they got such a complex game to work so well on a console controller is an absolutely incredible UI/UX achievement. I’m blown away at every turn, and after 40 hours of play, I’ve only scratched the surface. If this doesn’t merit a plethora of GOTY awards, I don’t know what does. The bar has been raised and that could not be more welcome in a gaming era rife with disappointment. There’s a learning curve for those unfamiliar with D&amp;D, but it’s well worth taking the time to acclimate.",0.1

Gameplay is great allowing creative planning and ways to deal with scenarios. There are some bug issues in the 3rd act that made my game crash at times. Some details don't become rendered in during the 3rd act just due to the shear amount of things on the map. I am bummed that I can only have 4 characters in my party at a time but it makes sense just due to how long it can take between turns. Overall, a great RPG that would recommend to any player.",0.09

"It is definitely the best RPG I have every played and one of the best video games. The variety of choices and consequences, the tailor-made battles, the amount of tiny details, the music and the voice acting, the overall story and the companion stories - everything is just amazing. I was concerned about playing it on PS5, but the interface there is even more convenient than on PC in my opinion. I spent 250 hours just on one playthrough looking at every corner and exploring and I still haven't found some rare loot, met some of the important NPCs or tried some of the classes for a different gameplay experience. If you like RPGs in general this game is definitely a must. At the same time there are some drawbacks as well. I think that the replayability is a bit overhyped. Yes, it is much better compared to majority of other RPGs and you can solve quests in multiple ways, but once you go through a quest, you can pretty much imagine the different possible outcomes. Same goes for battles - they are tailor-made, but that also means that once you go through them - it's not really interesting to do that again. But the biggest disappointment was the ending. Yes, there are many variants, but even 17000 unique endings that Larian promised are actually just a couple major directions and then a bunch of small puzzle pieces tagged on (if you take just 5 puzzle pieces out of a pool of 20 you will already get 15000 combinations, so that number is more PR than actual variability). I mean the game is still amazing while you are playing, it's just that at the end of an epic story it was a bit disappointing to see just several very short cutscenes. Also there could be a higher difficulty setting. If you have experience with turn-based games and just follow very basic combat tactics it is extremely easy even on tactician mode. I played the whole game on tactician without really min-maxing anything and even on hardest bosses had to reload maybe couple of times, mostly because I screwed something up myself. Finally, there are some glitches and bugs here and there, mostly in Act 3, because they obviously spent more time polishing the first 2 acts, but at the same time nothing is game breaking and for a game of such scale it's only natural.",0.09

This game got me hyped up, and I love it. Also how it works on the PS5, still the city needs a FPS update but all in all, this game is such a masterpiece. In no other games you question decisions that much like here. The nightsong quest I needed to restart 3 times to get the right outcome. For all other quests and decisions I leave it running and see what happens when I decide to the best of my knowledge. I am 110 hrs in the game now….there is so much to explore, this is crazy. There are so many moments where you say “wtf”…the dialogs are so well made, the ****. It feels good winning a crucial fight against a boss, when you figured out a good tactic which works out….I could say so much…but this is one of the best games ever made so far.What needs improvement on the PS5 is the FPS level to get 60 all the way and the loading times.I think after my first walk through I will get Divinity Original Sin II – I totally missed that game on my radar. And then a second run in BG3 will follow.A game made with love, without microtransactions, pure story, deep dive in the world – thank you for this!",0.1

The story and writing is peak the characters and backstory and lore peak the level of customisation and freedom and license for your character to be and play however you like is peak this game may be the definition of role playing game. If you don’t like the fantasy world and element it’s aiming for I could see that being an issue and I’ve had a few bugs and glitches but nothing a quick reload couldn’t fix for myself personally but what it does well overshadows all of that for me. Potential GOTY easily must play,0.1

"Baldur's Gate 3 fa da ponte tra i videogiocatori ed i giocatori di ruolo nel miglior modo possibile, appagando gli appassionati di GDRnel miglior modo visto fino ad ora e guidano gli inesperti in un modo facile ed intuitivo sin dalle prime ore di gioco nel mondo dei GDR e DnD. La grafica e la cura per i dettagli saltano immediatamente all'occhio sin dalla creazione ****, probabilmente la migliore di sempre. Il gioco presenta anche una trama ed una storia avvincente ed interessante oltre che unica vista la libertà di scelte che il giocatore può prendere vivendo la propria storia personale.

This is the closest thing you are going to get to dnd in a video game. The roleplay options are stellar. You can pick between tons of classes and races and it will effect your stats and gameplay. There is also a bizarre amount of ways you can finish some of these quests. You can talk your way out of a situation or kill everyone. It's so much fun!,0.1

Very good game. Possibly game of the year. What brings it down for me is all the bugs and a lackluster companion balance. Also had several crashes and companions that don't function properly. Companions sometimes fail on their story/romance since I didn't take long rests. Or that I couldn't recruit Jahira since she get stuck in a state. Had to replay sections because of this.,0.08

"I'm not finished with you Larian. My son bought this game on PS5, so that entitles me to review this game one more time. These game journalists and toy-collecting introverted millennials (who are ironically the most vocal on the internet) won't say anything bad about this game, so what I'm about to say needs be addressed. ""Enjoy the game to its fullest without any additional costs or microtransactions"" is that so? Then why does the PS5 version cost $70? The greedy developers are charging an extra $10 to PS5 owners for absolutely no reason. Technically those $10 are additional costs, meaning that Larian lied. If Larian was the ""consumer friendly"" company that everyone made them out to be, then why did they join the greedy trend of charging $10 extra for the PS5 version? This is EA behavior right here. ● This is a low quality buggy game for $70. In spite of that, it gets highly praised by critics and the ""story made me cry GOTY"" millennials. If Skyrim, Witcher 3, and now this garbage is anything to go by, it's pretty obvious that fantasy RPGs get a pass for low quality buggy trash lacking in detail. If it were anything else (especially COD and Ubisoft), these same people wouldn't shut up about it. These type of gamers are never consistent. Let's be honest, this is a $70 mobile game. Now I didn't even want to talk about the wokeness in this game, because literally every AAA game this decade is woke. But I'm getting real sick and tired of these conservative gamers ignoring the obvious wokeness of any game/studio that's an internet darling. They unironically think games like Fallout are anti-woke. I know you anti-woke millennials want to live in your little fantasy world where the best entertainment was made by conservatives, but you have to accept reality. Most game developers are liberals. ● The multiplayer is trash. What do so many games with microtransactions have in common? Most of them as far as I'm aware have a PvP mode. Does this have PvP? Yeah, I didn't think so. I don't ever want to see developers bragging about lack of MTX in their games if it doesn't have online PvP. If you're not greedy and lazy Larian, prove it. Give me a PvP mode. It shouldn't be too hard when so many low budget games have PvP. But let's face it, you won't do it because you know I'm right. And if you do add PvP, I bet you will go against your MTX beliefs. This is a generic RPG mobile game, yet we have developers pretending this is an anomaly in a pathetic attempt to trick gamers into believing this is high quality to decrease workload. No it isn't. A game like GTA V for instance is an anomaly, which is why GTA VI is easily the most anticipated game right now. I don't recommend this game at all. ● P.S. Metacritic, quit deleting reviews you don't agree with. Larian literally lied about no additional costs for BG3. An extra $10 for PS5 owners is an additional cost. That's not even my opinion, it's a fact. Despite the lies being in front of everyone's face, no one is going to acknowledge it, so my review deserves to stay up. If this were COD or sports games, you would've let it slide. This game is just as woke, cringe, broken, and low quality as Saints Row. If the latter is hated, why does this game get a pass? Learn to accept different opinions Metacritic.",0.0
Best game I’ve played on ps5. Definitely a must play multiple times.,0.1
"Whilst Act 1 is pure perfection, as you mosey on through to act two, it suddenly takes a small turn for the worst. Bugs, unable to complete certain quests because of said bugs. Textures not loading up properly, being catapulted off of lifts for no reason, crashing my entire PS5 so I had to hard reset it. Act 3  feels rushed,is even worse for all these things, houses etc not loading up properly so you can see everything inside them,. NPC's talking to you but not showing up, or them talking to another character in your party although you were the one to start the conversation. It's like they lost enthusiasm at the final hurdle. The ending, well that left a sour taste in my mouth. After everything you go through as a group, the dialogue suggesting something awesome is coming and will conclude it all nicely, only for the rug to be pulled from under my feet and it cut to black, almost mid sentence, Soprano's all over again .but in a game format. No new game plus, no continuation of running around with your best pals. No end game content whatsoever. If DLC does not come out to expand upon this, then my next playthroughs of this will be met with less enthusiasm, but I want the platinum, so I shall try my best. I just wish they would put in more effort when it comes to endings these days. Bugs I can understand here and there, but for a game that was in development for literal years, beta testing for over two years I believe and met with thunderous praise, it should be in better condition than it is at present.",0.05
"This is the best CRPG I have ever played, and I’ve been playing these games since the old Bards Tale and Dragon Wars.  There is one fight in hell that was so epic I had to watch it again on YouTube after I beat it.  Take it from me: don’t spoil yourself with this game and minimize the save scumming.",0.1
"The game gets boring quite quickly. The huge amount of RNG in every single aspect of the game (dialogues, fights, even simply walking around) ruins the game. Especially since the game is very long, and has a lot of content.",0.05
"This game is what gamers have been asking for a polished and finished game filled with content that doesn't hold your hand or ask you to cough up more money, sure the final act is a bit shaky but that is miniscule compared to how smooth the rest of the game works, music, mechanics, art style and a story that really make me proud of being a gamer",0.1
"I bought the game for ps5 a few days ago, I admit I was a little afraid of the turn-based combat system, I was also afraid that the inventory management would not be complicated, but I was positively disappointed, this game is seriously a masterpiece, the sounds, the transition videos are 10/10 quality, like the game itself the graphics are also beautiful, I don't know when was the last time I played an RPG of this qualityin the game you have a lot of options in the battle I knocked down a chandelier in a fight he took so much damage against it that after that it was only a few spells and they died there was a part where I simply couldn't get to what was the solution? I jumped over the rocks to reach my goal, the game gives you amazing freedom, you can practically do everything in it if you think a little bit, you can crush your opponents in amazing ways, for me this game is 10/10, but rather 10/11 I recommend it to everyone, it's mandatory!!!",0.1
"One of the best rpg's sinne witcher 3, as an old man (40 ish) as me that have been along since bg1 and 2 during the late 90's i first had my doubts. But I can honestly say that my doubts about it were wrong, instead it blew my expectations like no other rpghas done in almost a decade now.",0.1
"Absolutely one of the best video games I have ever played. You can really tell when playing Baldur's Gate 3 that the developers put an incredible amount of time, love, and creativity into it. The amount of content in this game is insane. I'm on my first play through on PS5 and I spent over 100 hours in Act 1 alone and I am currently now at over 300 hours total playtime halfway through Act 3 (and im pretty positive ive even missed some stuff! But that is for my other playthroughs lol). My only criticisms about this game are incredibly minor and I know that Larian is actively working on some of them. Like Act 3 does have most of the bugs I have encountered (none of them game-breaking) but like I said Larian has very clearly been quick and on top of fixing bugs with their frequent hotfixes (like restoring His Majesty back to his lovely bald self) and every game is bound to have bugs but it's on how the developers/creators respond to them that makes or breaks a game IMO. The minor criticisms I have is that I wish there was the option of a customizable camp tent for Tav. I think it would make a lot of sense for us to be able to give Tav a tent just like companions. Also I really love the relationships you can have with the companions and I think they are beautifully written (at least the Astarion relationship) but I do agree with what I've seen other players mention online is that I wish there was the option to not only kiss your romantic partner (which is already available after a certain point) but to be able to hug them at will as well as potentially cuddle with them. Possibly even once you get into Act 3 a date quest where you can spend some quality time with your romantic companion. The last thing is that in a recent hotfix they changed how talking with companions works and now the camera snaps back to Tav after the companion stops talking and I really wish they would revert that change back to how it was before. Before you would talk to your companion and the camera would remain on their face after the dialogue when returning to the dialogue choices and this doesnt have to be with any other characters or NCPs in the game but i think it really enhanced the real feel of the dialogue between Tav and the companions. It was also just plain lovely to be able to see Astarions microexpressions and the amazing animations. But at this point like I said those are really minor honestly they're just wishes I have for the game. The gameplay itself is intriguing and for a complete newbie to D&amp;D and turn based RPGs, is an amazing introduction to the genre, game, and game type. It took a little bit to get the hang of the combat and game play but the tutorial hints help a lot and it was fairly easy to learn as I went through the game. I think this game will introduce many people to the lovely world of D&amp;D who might never have gotten into it otherwise. This was a genius game to make. D&amp;D the video game essentially (also romance simulator lol). The storyline is rich with an incredible amount of lore throughout the game in both story and things you can find and it is a very intriguing story that **** you right in and leaves you wanting more. I would give literally all of my money to Larian for DLC or just any more content in general because I love this game so much. I think this is above and beyond game of the year. It might not seem like much but to finally have a video game that is ""finished"" with no in game purchases and other predatory gaming practices (like most games have been for the past 5-10 years) with an amazing studio like Larian who very clearly care about their players, is a breath of fresh air and I think is going to hopefully change the game industry for the better. The overwhelming success of the game is a clear statement that gamers have had enough of other developers and studios (particularly AAA studios) treating us like cash cows and that they would see more money and success if they just treated their players with respect. Nobody wants to spend money on a game that isnt good. Also the voice acting is incredible and I hope some of the actors win awards this year. Particularly Neil Newbon. His portrayal of Astarion is some of the best acting I have ever seen in a video game. I cannot overstate how much I love this game. 10/10. Would recommend.",0.1

"Wow, just wow. This was my first time ever playing a turn-based RPG and I didn’t know anything about D&amp;D going into this. I usually play games like GTA, FIFA and shooters, so I did not expect to like or understand this game. I was wrong. The first hours were hard. I did not understand the fighting mechanics and I was close to giving up.  As you can see from this review, I did not.. I decided to play a little bit more, and 2 hours turned into 5 hours, and 5 hours turned into 50 hours, and 50 hours to 100 hours…. This is the best story I have ever experienced in a game. All the choices, mistakes and accomplishments matters and I am able to craft my own story. How is it even possible to make a game where there is a story line for ever possible outcome? I can’t wrap my head around how much time and passion the developers must have put in to this. I played it for so long and did so many quests, but I still feel like I just scratched the surface of the game, and I am ready to play it again and do things differently. I usually never want to play the story from a single-player game more than once, but I feel like I can play this 5 more times and have completely different experiences and outcomes. I still don’t understand half of it, and the game is hard,  but that is just fine. There is so much to learn, so many more stories to experience. I finally understand why so many people like these type of games. 10/10! Btw, remember to backup save all the time! I learned that the hard way…",0.1

It's a great experience that can be played for hundreds of hours. There is no limit to what can be done. I've never played a game where I've had so much freedom before. It was great that the decisions we made affected the game so strongly. You definitely feel that you are playing a real role-playing game. The war part is also very successful. Sometimes there are moments when you have difficulties and you feel like you will never get over it. But you make a strategy change and actually see how easy it can be.

"Despite what the PS5 reviews are saying to try and be only positive, there's some important con's that keep it below a 5. Baldur's Gate 3 on PC is amazing. A masterpiece **** where the graphics are tremendous and gameplay is investing and brings you in for the long haul. Rarely will you stumble upon glitches or bugs, or anything game breaking. On PS5 however, it will constantly freeze in battles, framerates drop in larger battles [which are everywhere like the Goblin fortress], and the system runs hot during these times. Really hot. I'd recommend making sure you have proper ventilation. Outside that the story is the same obviously. Gameplay is the same but slower on console.

"Estou jogando no ps5 e tô achando um jogo realmente muito bom. Eu coloquei na dificuldade mais fácil pois tinha medo das mecânicas e tô conseguindo jogar muito bem. Ainda há bastante desafio. Mas é totalmente possível jogar. Já tenho 20 horas e todo surpreende. Acombate delicioso. Depois que você entende que há movimentos com custo de magia, movimento que você sempre pode fazer sem custo e que são 2 ações. Uma ação e um truque as ideias começam a vir e o jogo vai virando. Vai fluindo. Realmente é muito bom. Infelizmente há queda de fps na exploração. Mas nada que me deixasse com dor de cabeça nem algo que me irritasse como já aconteceu com outros jogos. É um jogo MUITO imersivo. Ritmo de um ótimo livro que vai se desenrolando tranquilamente. Muito gostoso e interessante. Realmente recomendo e nunca havia jogado um jogo assim. Bem diferente de final fantasy, persona, the witcher. Talvez the Witcher seja o que levemente mais pareça. Eu gosto de fire emblem e tem algo levemente semelhante. Então seria uma mistura entre um the witcher 3 com fire emblem nas minhas referências. Universo incrível. O jogo flui. Você senta pra jogar e as coisas se desenvolvem e te envolvem. Muito bom. Já tinha experiências altas e só tinha medo da complexidade. Mas não precisa ter esse medo. Realmente o jogo consegue desenrolar mesmo que te assuste um pouco no início. Mesmo com os leves probleminhas de performance pontuais, para mim, é nota 10.",0.1
This game needs to take game of the year on my opinion love how many options i got of playing this ,0.1
"The way they worked out the controller to work for something like this is really incredible, and preferable to mouse in keyboard imho. Game of the year by quite a margin in my book. The level of detail the designers put into this game is phenomenal. No, you might not like it if all you play are ARPGs. You will love it if you played any CRPGs in your history, game board or computer type.",0.1
"Content is great, but ergonomy and loading times are sometimes abysmal. The design of the game itself forces you to constantly reload and save like crazy, resulting in fustrating trial and error with long loading times.",0.08
One of the best games ever made. It's as good as Baldur's Gate 2 and Planescape Torment. A masterpiece.,0.1

"Just.... Wow. My son, my girlfriend and I are obsessed. My daughter loves to watch and hear. It's really game changing. I loved the idea of D&amp;D but haven't had the luxury to play. I've also played some of the first Baulder's Gate when I was a kid. This has got to be the best video game I've ever played, genuinely. I thought for sure Hogwarts Legacy was going to win GOTY, we're a huge Harry Potter family... Baulder's Gate 3 beat my fan bias lol. This game is phenomenal. I want more, but also there's already so, so much! It's addicting for sure. Thank you Larian, for sharing this absolute gem with the world.",0.05
"Indubbiamente molte cose funzionano egregiamente, ma è troppo di nicchia. Se non ti piace il genere, a meno che tu non ti faccia trascinare dall'entusiasmo degli youtuber, non ti piacerà nemmeno questo. Combattimenti a turni per me noiosi, game play classico di movimentazione **** a gregge. Non fa per me. Detto questo, nel genere, ben fatto. Ma nulla più.",0.05

"Best game of 2023. It gives complete freedom unlike Starfield which is very boring and empty. Every nook and crany in Baldur's Gate 3 is full of stuff. There are different ways to tackle a fight, a scenario or a quest. This is a must try game.",0.1

"Made for a PC. The controls are best with mouse and keyboard. Inventory management is a chore. Very similar to Original Sin 2, with a pseudo-Dnd rules (not 5th - more like Pathfinder 2 action economy). Combat is sloooo2 and prone to exploits that haven't been patched. Good  cinematics and story, but just watch a Netflix show.",0.03
"Starting this review off by saying I've played both on PC and PS5 and I'm leaving this review on the PS5 version to offset the review bombs by fanboys that are mad the game isn't currently on Xbox due to the technical issues Larian had with the Series S. My actual score would be a 9.8 if I could make a more customizable score. With the .2 of a point being knocked off for things like the somewhat annoying inventory systems, an example being you can't access inactive companions' inventories leading to clunky management to sort inventories. Also there are some annoyances with the camera and NPCs (generally being friendly NPCs) choosing the dumbest/useless choices/moves in combat. Other than those few things though the game is the closest to a perfect game in years, from the voice acting and characters, to the choices and consequences, and the music is amazing as well, and despite all the variables in scenes the music generally fits perfectly and improves the scenes. The options in both combat and exploration are massive and your class or classes add even more. As this review is for the PS5 version I should mention the controller controls, despite importing my level 12 character finding all my spells and abilities was pretty easy to do (and in some ways even better/easier than with the Keyboard and Mouse controls) and the framerate, other than the actual city of Baldur's Gate, was mostly good/steady, and to get an nearly stable framerate you could use the 30FPS mode as well.",0.1
"Amazing RPG, almost impossible to put down. The story, characters, graphics and even gameplay are completely enjoyable. But! Where's my photo mode?",0.09
"I initially did not think I would enjoy this game as the gameplay was nothing like I have ever played before however, the amount of people talking ans hyping this game up made me want to try it for myself and Holy **** does it deserve every bit of attention and praise it is getting. I love the characters, the world, the gameplay, the story, the choices, the insane amount of content crambed into this single game. I am glad I have tried it and I'm glad it was worth every penny of mine.",0.1

If you loved Divinity Original Sin 2 then this will be the best game you ever played. If you hated Divinity Original Sin you will also Hate this game it is that simple. They are basically the same except Baldurs Gate 3 made it easier to learn and play than Divinity was. This type of game plays best with a mouse and keyboard it is not well suited for consoles IMO. That is pretty much all you need to know.,0.09

Played this game basically for the exploration and world building just about hate the turn base combat system and if it weren't for that I'd give this game a perfect score it just takes way to long to defeat enemies they really need to add in the setting or something were you can fight like a normal action game.,0.03

"Ok for starters doesn’t really play that well on ps5. Can’t find where I have to go. Map is terrible. This spoils the great dialogue, audio and fighting.  So I find after pre ordering the game I had difficulty getting into the game.  There are really good things about the game but it did not get me addicted. I put it down for a week and never felt to pick it up again.  I found this having way too many technical problems which made the gameplay complicated and confusing.  Didn’t really like the way they implemented the wheels.  Give it a 4/10. Wasted my money.  No immersion. Just could not enjoy this game.",0.04

BG3 has set the bar so high there will be nothing to match it in the years to come and maybe a once in a lifetime type of game.  Thousands of hours of gameplay, there is so much to do and see around literally every corner. Tachician difficultly makes combat extremely strategic, rewarding and fun.  If you like rpg's you should absolutely buy this master piece, you will not be disappointed.  Lets hope for dlc.",0.1

Absolutely beautiful game. This is the type of game I’ve been waiting for. They amount of choices and decisions you can make is actually insane. This game definitely should win Goty if I’m being honest or Zelda.,0.1
"So after giving this ""game"" a real chance for 55 hours it seems like a cutscene gauntlet that is only able to keep most players invested by using awkwardly animated sex scenes as the cheese for degenerates. It seems like the devs had a golden idea not in pure game design but how to catch the attention of people who never interact with real people. Seems kind of a cheap way to try and blow up in popularity. People will say they just don't engage with it but everyone knows they're lying. It's such a shame that this is being considered as game of the year by mostly porn addicts. Something like this should be rated AO and not be allowed to be streamed on Twitch since there might be children watching. I honestly think you need psychiatric help if you're in denial that this game is not a cheap way at gaining an audience through promoting deviance. On top of all that the performance is horrid.",0.0

This is the first RPG since Mass Effect trilogy that actually has me hooked. Like any good RPG, your engagement with the world, committing to making choices and experimentation is actually rewarded, meaningful and beautifully executed across gameplay systems and story telling. Every once in a while any medium whether it be gaming, movies books or comics, a true masterpieces comes to set new standards. Highly recommend it anyone looking to get lost in an immersive story driven experience. Imagine not growing doing hardcore nerd stuff like magic the gathering or DnD and now being curious as an adult, that's how good it is.",0.1

This game give you the choices to literally play however you want. The graphics look fantastic, not quite as good as other PS5 games. But considering how ambitious the game is it's not an issue. The game does have some performance issues particularly in later acts. However they don't detract much from the game as it is turn based and does not rely on quick reaction speeds.

"Baldurs Gate 3 delivers, from it's unique story, likeable characters, and extensive character creation. The story is so in depth that you end up losing track of time and just want to keep playing. It's turn based style element, isn't one I'm usually into but given the fact that is the world of Dungeons and Dragons it's extremely fitting for the games immersive storyline. The dice rolling element is a welcome addition and adds to the immersive element. It feels like I'm playing a Dungeons and Dragons campaign. I highly recommend it and encourage everyone to give this game a try. I tip my hat to Larian Studios, I can't wait to see what they add into the game in the future.",0.1

"Played this on PC first. PS5 version is second for better co-op experience, from the standpoint that my family is remote and they don't have all PC's.  LOVE this game. So many choices and so much variety.  You have to like this game style, but if you are a DnD or Pathfinder player, this shouldn't be an issue. If your a Call of Duty player and looking for more of the same, this is not the game for you.  I do wish we could use a mouse/keyboard on the PS5 though, as it does help manage the overwhelming amount of things you can do more efficiently than a controller. On the flip side, they have done some amazing things with the controller implementation. Looking forward to cross-play as well.  Overall, this is the best DnD game EVER MADE, and I've been around for 5 decades of gaming going back to the old Pong across many platforms.  Larian has done an exceptional job and they deserve all the praise they get for their hard work and their continued efforts in bringing out the best of the game.",0.1
"You gonna like it if you like very traditional turn-based RPG, otherwise you are going to be tortured by the rhythm. Storyline is normal. Overall not as outstanding as the hype going on out there.

Of the minuses - poor performance In ONE LOCATION in act 3, a change in the storyline of halasin and insufficient scale of the ending. But it's still the best game I've played since Witcher",0.1

So far I’m about 40 hours into the game. I’m still on act one and can’t put this game down! The world is beautiful, and I can’t help exploring every inch of it! The characters are very well written and all feel real and worth investing time into. The combat is fun and engaging. I find myself really enjoying the turn based combat. I’ve never really enjoyed it but with this game I’ve gone into it with an open mind and it’s actually a lot of fun working out what I can do and how I can take out the enemies. This game is a breath of fresh air and it’s nice to play a game at launch that is completely finished and not a broken buggy mess. Yes there are some issues with frame rates but nothing game breaking. And I’m very happy with the idea that this game has no microtransactions no payed dlc it’s a one time payment and you have hundreds of hours of content. The studio really should be proud of themselves for putting a lot of love and care into a game, one that is easily my contender for game of the year!",0.1

Tiene sus detalles, pero todo juego lo tiene, como pantallas de carga que me gustarían que fueran más rápidas principalmente; el control es verdad que se nota que su base es teclado y ratón, pero la adaptación a mando es muy buena y por lo demás el juego me ha funcionado muy bien. Amigos gamer a disfrutar siempre de los videojuegos.",0.1

So this is my first turn based game. Personally Eldin ring is my favorite game of all time. Loved the exploration and density of the world. This game is giving me a similar feeling and I love it. Have never played a game so dense with content that's actually enjoyable to do and not recycled throughout the world. To those on the fence just give it a shot. It's special.,0.1

Don't listen to any of the bad reviews.  They're literally giving bad scores just because the game is turn based. That's not fair at all.  If you don't like something then don't buy something that's exactly what you know you don't like.  The game is fantastic and runs great on ps5. Everyone doing its got low fps are just review bombing this or are too stupid to figure out how to put the game in performance mode.  This game proves turn based is still wanted and better than real time when it comes to combat. More strategy and skill required which is why so many people are giving bad scores just for that.  If you don't have an above average iq then don't get this game.  If you do then you'll love the challenge.,0.05

"When a game manages to make you think about it and play it with your mind even when you're not sitting at the console and waiting for the time to pass to re-enter this beautiful world and continue your journey then somewhere there you just realize that you are dealing with a real masterpiece. Incredible gameplay mechanics with tons of different approaches to a battle, fantastic depth to the characters, you really bond with them and literally get into the role you're playing with your character and fantastic co-op, incredible that a game like this in 2023 supports split screen couch local co-op which really works and in a very interesting renewed way. Being able to give a dualsense to a friend at any time and to sit side by side and play together with the screen switching incredibly smoothly to split screen and back to full screen, without having to enter a different menu, is an experience that can only be described as positive. It's been a while since I've gotten so hooked on a game and what makes it even better is that we're already in a very good year for gaming as there have already been very good games released across all systems and the year isn't even over yet strong releases are coming and the Baldur's Gate III is up against games that, had they been released in previous years, would have easily won the GOTY. And he has managed among all this to already set the bar very high to be this year's GOTY.",0.1

It’s the first game I genuinely enjoy clearing all side quests and spending stupid amount of my time on it too! It plays smooth like butter. Very nice controls and easy to understand mechanics.

"What a game. This is what should be the benchmark when calling something game of the generation. I’ve never played a game where I’ve had as much fun and gave a sense of adventure like this. Split screen has its issues but it’s things that can be patched and Larian is working hard to provide said patches having already made 2 hotfixes in the span on 4 days. The story is captivating, characters main or npc look amazing. Scenery and setting is gorgeous. Haven’t come across a single thing that looks procedurally generated. Load screens are also a bit long but considering the amount of data to load and it’s understandable given that this is their first next gen console game. Time to party!!!",0.1

"This has been a fantastic experience for me. I just cannot believe how amazing this game is and what an incredible leap forward from Baldur’s Gate 2. The graphics are beautiful and stunning, the dialogue is top-notch and well acted. The amount of effort that’s gone into preparing this game (year+ early access) to mould the game into what fans want and iron out bugs as meant it’s easily the game of the year. I’ve read one criticism in a user review of them not liking how it’s turn-based. The thing is you have the option to turn that off and revert to real-time with pause; they haven’t removed it, it’s just that users have decided they prefer turn-based. Personally, I love this new style of combat. As for issues with Act 3, we’ll I’m not there yet so can’t comment except to say, I’m certain the developers will work incredibly hard to remedy these and are likely to be PS5 related issues. Hold your breath and I’m sure they’ll be fixed.",0.1

Volo ftw!! I’ve not encountered any bug that’s game breaking or more than a quirk, which can’t be rectified with a quick fix.They patched out the bugs that are getting dog-pile media attention (HDR, audio) before day one official release date.

"Hands down best RPG you could play. I bought it both on PC and on PS5. The mechanics work almost flawlessly on controller it has some slight jack, but it hasn't taken away from my immersive experience. Role-Playing just about any character you could want has never been easier than with this game at least in my personal experience.  For my PS5 playthrough I decided to play as a half elf bard and conman. It's been quite the fun experience bringing this character to life and tackling situations as he would have in my mind. The story and characters are extremely compelling and the maps are massive. Reactivity is at an all time high. Combat is some of the best I've played and this is coming from someone who usually hates turn based Combat. This system won me over though for building my party effectively paying attention to the environment, and strategizing on using it with my abilities to the fullest. It feels like a loving breathing world and it's refreshing to have a game where I'm not special I'm just a dude with a worm in my head with other people with the same issue. Here's to many more adventures in Faerûn. Huzzah!",0.1

"Baldur's Gate 3, the latest installment in this beloved RPG series, is a mixed bag for me. The biggest point of contention lies in its shift to turn-based combat. While some players appreciate the added strategic depth this change brings, I miss the fast-paced real-time battles of previous titles. Nonetheless, the game shines in its rich storytelling and character development, offering an immersive world that captures the essence of the Forgotten Realms. Visually, it impresses with detailed environments and character models. In sum, Baldur's Gate 3 delivers a compelling experience, but the shift in combat style may leave players divided based on their personal preferences.",0.07

The game is complicated - especially to those who are not familiar with DnD mechanics - and you're required to really take your time with it. Otherwise you might still find it good, but you wouldn't even begin to understand the scale of its greatness. Visually stunning, great Performance on PS5, insane (!) gameplay options and one of the most immersive gaming experiences i've ever had.

"I have heard nothing but raving reviews for this game of the year winner, but the more I progressed through it, I slowly learned this is not a game for me. First and foremost, I see why so many people love this game. This game has so much creative storytelling, different paths, unique characters, etc. You can play the game however you want really. That aspect of the game I do praise and specifically why big D&amp;D or fantasy fans love the game. I went into this game with an open mind, but the sheer tediousness of the game tired me out. I am a big completionist and was trying to do as much of the side quests and exploration as I could, but I always found myself stuck and spent ages trying to figure out how to do things on my own, however it often ended up with me googling stuff. There are so many books, scrolls, inscriptions to read and long winded dialogues you need to pay attention to. There is so little in the way of direction in this game with barely any waypoints or markers, you really have no idea where to look for some of these quests, how to open something, where to go next, how to get someone new in your party, etc. One bad decision and your whole play through could be ruined. The game rarely auto saves, so you will lose lots of progress if you try and do things over again. The combat I found to be OK, pretty difficult at times with a steep learning curve. I don’t mind some level of puzzles and figuring things out, but this game just takes it to a whole new level. Not a bad game by any means, but simply is not for me.",0.07
I liked it well enough. Some things not so much other thing I did. If you can find the right mods it can have a better and trie to story play through.,0.07
"I don't like Baldur's Gate 3 because it feels slow and boring compared to other games. The combat is turn-based, which makes the action drag on, and the story feels too complicated and hard to follow. The dialogue scenes take too long, and I often lose interest. The graphics and character animations feel stiff, and it doesn’t have the same excitement or fast-paced gameplay that I enjoy in other RPGs, making it hard to stay engaged.",0.0

Most of the games that have been released are just cheap, monotonous, money-driven projects, and this game showed me that. It's evident that this game was made with passion. The possibilities and combinations in the game are nearly endless, and there’s so much you can do. The game is so addictive that I couldn't get away from my computer for hours. It completely wiped out my social life. I couldn’t play it while on vacation, and since universities will reopen shortly after I return, I haven’t started playing again. I'm waiting for the holidays to dive back in and play without any distractions.",0.1

"What more can be said about Baldur's Gate 3? An incredibly ambitious role-playing game in the modern era that pushes the boundaries of player choice and freedom in video games. Fans of RPGs such as the Dragon Age series will be right at home. Acts one and two are both flawless, 10 out of 10s. My problem is with Act three. The whole narrative just grinds to a halt, and the pacing loses its momentum, making the game feel like a bit of a chore. Characters don't have much to say. Every fight takes forever with huge numbers of boring enemies. You're already overleveled at this point, so fighting feels unrewarding and pointless. Technical issues start popping up everywhere. The two villains miss the mark for me, and the storytelling just falters after such a strong first two acts. Don't get me wrong. It's not bad at all, but it feels underwhelming; sometimes less is more. Nonetheless, BG3 is a triumph ****, in an age of developers not taking risks and pushing out microtransaction-filled garbage. This is a title that should be celebrated.",0.1

"Was für ein monumentales Meisterwerk! Baldur´s Gate 3 ist ohne jeden Zweifel mein Spiel des Jahres 2023, mit großem, sehr großem Abstand. Überwältigend gute, kreative Story, eine unbeschreiblich immersive Atmosphäre, es sind Elemente für jeden nur erdenklichen Gemütszustand dabei, sowohl bei den vielfältigen Dialogen, als auch den Kämpfen, den mannigfaltigen Entscheidungsmöglichkeiten mit ECHTEM Impact auf den weiteren Spielverlauf, bis hin zum phänomenalen Soundtrack, der das gesamte, riesige Spektrum von BG3 grandios untermalt und auch trägt. Das Spiel ist so gut wie bugfrei (ich hatte niemals Hardcrashes oder Game Breaking Bugs, unerklärliche Frame-Einbrüche o.Ä.), es hat umfassende Settings, einen mehr als DnD-würdigen Charaktereditor, die Tutorials sind intuitiv und lassen die Lernkurve nicht all zu steil werden. Die Performance ist gut, die Steuerung komplex aber super durchdacht und logisch aufgebaut. Die Kampagne kann schon mal über 120 Stunden dauern, wenn man auch die vielen, interessanten Subquests mitnimmt. Es finden sich auch immer wieder krasse Plot Twists (Game of Thrones Vibes) im Spiel, was mein WTF-Meter gesprengt und gleichzeitig die Spannung stets hoch gehalten hat. Habe direkt nach Release zwei Durchgänge gespielt und beim Zweiten Mal nochmals komplett neue Regionen, NPCs und Questreihen entdeckt, die mir beim ersten Mal entgangen waren. Hierbei geholfen hat auch die Wahl von völlig unterschiedlichen Charakterklassen, die den Spielverlauf durchaus verändern können, je nach deren Können oder Unvermögen... Bin nun nach einigen Monaten Pause im dritten Durchgang und es macht wieder genauso viel Spaß wie zuvor. BG3 hat nicht zuletzt deshalb, aber vor allem auch wegen den vielen verschiedenen wählbaren Klassen einen tollen Wiederspielwert. Manche Quests bzw. Spielmechaniken sind sehr komplex und etwas kryptisch, so dass ich einen Guide zu Rate ziehen musste, auch Charakter Skillguides waren hier sehr hilfreich. Man kann sich mit den Charakteren identifizieren, kann an ihrem Leben und ihrer Gesinnung teilhaben, es sind nicht nur fahle Lückenfüller. So viel Liebe und Leidenschaft für klassische RPGs steckt in diesem Spiel, es ist schlicht überwältigend. Mein einziger Kritikpunkt sind die meiner Meinung nach teils schwachen bzw. zweifelhaften Männer-Rollen, denn z.B. ein aktiver Gale im Team ""frisst"" einem den wertvollen Loot weg, was gerade Anfangs, wo man noch nicht weiß, wie viel guter Loot noch kommen mag oder ob man sich hier nicht sein ökonomisches Grab schaufelt oder dadurch zu kampfschwach sein würde, wirklich eine große Antipathie aufkommen lässt. Auch Wyll ist eher uninteressant, der ""Teufelspakt"" Background mit der überbewerteten, aber dennoch sehr omnipräsenten Mizora hat mir nicht sehr gefallen. Außer diesem kleinen Jammern auf hohem Niveau hatte ich schon sehr, sehr lange kein solch fesselndes, exzellentes Game mehr in meiner Possession. Ich kann die Low-Rated User Reviews teils nicht verstehen, denen ist das Spiel im Rundenmodus zu langsam und zu langweilig (als würde man sich bei einem Shooter beschweren, dass geschossen wird), manche kriegen nicht raus, wie man die nächsten Storyelemente triggert (Journal + Map benutzen, lesen und die entsprechenden Leute anquatschen sollte doch kein Problem sein...), ein paar wenige finden das Storywriting schlecht (natürlich kann man es nicht allen recht machen aber es gibt so viele emotionale, philosophische, kritische und herausragende Dialoge in BG3, da habe ich schon deutlich schlechteres gesehen), ein paar Leuten ist das Spiel zu woke. Die meisten dieser Kritikpunkte sind Schall und Rauch wenn man sich VOR dem Kauf darüber informiert, dass es ein DnD Game mit entsprechenden Mechaniken ist. Manche Punkte sind für mich auch eher in der Faulheit oder Linearität mancher Casual Gamer zu suchen, die generell in diesem RPG-Genre keinen Halt finden werden. Akt3 scheint verhasst zu sein, dem kann ich nicht zustimmen, alles war für mich genauso spannend und unterhaltend wie zuvor oder danach. Ob BG3 zu woke ist? Es ist tatsächlich sehr liberal gehalten und es gibt viele ""Diverse"" Kreaturen im Spiel, auffällig viele Frauen haben mächtige Rollen, das ist aber eher eine Randnotiz und würde mich insbesondere angesichts der vielen herausragenden anderen Aspekte des Spiels nicht zu einem Low Score verleiten. Andere sagen, es wäre nur mit Mods (Traglast+ usw.) spielbar, finde ich aber in der Vanilla völlig in Ordnung. Ich bedanke mich herzlich bei den Larian Studios für dieses herausragende Spiel, welches nebenbei bemerkt von Anfang an komplett ist und weder Mikrotransaktionen, noch dieses lächerliche Games as a service Modell und sonstigen, Consumerfeindlichen Irrwitz aufweist. Ein vollständiges, vollmundiges und rundes Erlebnis, im Prinzip auch schon ohne Mods. 10/10. Bedingungungslos empfehlenswert!",0.1

"I just have to balance out the overrating a but.Graphics are only nice-ish. Characters, especially the ones you can create look kind of weird and ugly. Facial animation is wooden.Inventory management is HELL, absolute HELL. The game floods you with total useless stuff. I read there is about 800 trash items in the game. I literally need like 2 or 3 mods to make the inventory and selling trash not make me go insane. Game presents rooms with 20 containers to you you have to click all 1by1 and loot mostly useless **** in hope for something good. ""Leather boots"" with no armor rating that are just visual, clothes that have no purpose then to make you look ugly. WAY to much items. I do not like spending so much time in inventory. Party inventory can not be sorted, sorting is not permanent and as soon as you move one item its all messed up again so you have to resort all the time. Not fun at all. The fact that your inventory and weight is split among characters adds to so much useless pain that I consider a weight limit remover mod on top of my trash auto-sell and autoloot mods now. The stuff the game throws at you **** the fun out of the game for me I can not stress this enough. It feels like intentional annoying the player.Difficulty ""Tactician"" is more like trial and error then to actually learn to be ""Tactical"".Loading times are **** pathfinding is bugged, they sometimes do not follow you jumping. They run into traps, you have ungroup them out of combat to navigate traps sometimes, not very fun gameplay. Running into traps and then reloading is not fun gameplay.Seeing stupid Dice Roll screens that are slow AF and you already see early on that you passed it but you have to sit through the animations of bonuses all the time. You win 90%+if these screens anyway. This strict D&amp;D stuff for a modern game is the wrong choice IMO. Could be done better, something that fits a modern game better.Game is woke AF but even if you like that it for sure does not deserve this insane ratings. Not saying its a bad game but its so overrated. Its a decent turn based party RPG if that is what you like you probably like that game but acting like this is the best RPG ever made is total delusion.",0.0

All of my following attempts to finish the game ended the same way, I couldn't be bothered to finish it due to lack of engaging gameplay. There was clearly a lot of work that went into the game I can tell, even if some of the lead developers walk around wearing BG3 cosplay armour(as though that's not cringe). I can understand that fans of Dungeons &amp; Dragons may really love this game, but I think it's quite a niche thing in my opinion.",0.06

A game where choices really matter and aren't just presented in a fake manner which pretends that they matter.

I love many games but this is the only true 10/10 which I feel comfortable giving.  I think the phrases and monikers of “10/10"" and ""masterpiece” are thrown around too frequently.

"It's horrendous. It should have never seen the light of day. I might write a long review, but I don't want to waste my time on this one. There are 3 reasons why this game should not exist. 1) Baldur's Gate 2 was the end of the story. Period. 2) If Baldurs Gate 3 ever existed, it would be an infinity engine/Aurora engine game and it would be developed by Black Isle Studios. The game was in development and was named the Black Hound Project. That was the ONLY BG3 supposed to happen. 3) The third and final reason is that games today have evolved differently, and so many things have changed. You should not use the old classic IP and ruin the legacy of one of the best CRPG-s ever made. Just to milk the money and create ''modern games that are tailored for modern gamers so that everyone can enjoy them''. The vision never existed. The artistic component never existed. Respect for one's legacy never existed. Larian created the Divinity game in a dungeons and dragons setting and called it Baldurs Gate 3. It is despicable and dishonourable, and hence the sole reason why this game should not exist.",0.01

"Baldur's Gate 3 has a strong start but struggle in the later stages. The third act is a disaster, making the game nearly unplayable. Combat becomes boring and repetitive, with long enemy turns and limited options. The environments are dreary and uninspiring, making exploration a chore. The story and characters are underwhelming, and the music doesn't add much. Resting mechanics are flawed—you sometimes can't even rest in certain zones. It's no wonder that only a small percentage of players finish the game. Overall, this game is overrated and fails to live up to its hype. Not recommended.

No other game I have seen that makes actions have this much of a consequence. 95% of char don't have plot Armor, and you can skip major chunks of story and replace it for something else for a playthrough.

"(MY SCORE : 9.2 /10)  This Party-Based RPG game is really exciting. The large area is supported by stunning graphics and almost all NPCs can be talked to and almost every house / building can be entered! This game is also rich in varied stories. And the Turn-Based Combat System is certainly a challenge in itself!It's just that we might still encounter bugs when undertaking missions that are quite confusing. Yup, often the Mission Markers in this game are not very helpful as clues to trigger story progress. There is no difference in markers between the Main Mission and Side Mission, it is possible that the Player of this game will experience ""Stuck"". Apart from the shortcomings above, I think this game is almost perfect.",0.09
"Meh, unplayable without a few key mods, glad I waited a while too the list of bug fixes and updates is really just pathetic. No one comes out with working games anymore they just release garbage and expect you to wait years for fixes.

"Got this after all the hype. And so far I don't get it. The game itself is good, and maybe it's not for me but the combat is dull. I just am not excited to get into confrontations. It takes for ever and is not exciting. I do a move and then 10 other characters make a move and then me again. It's slow and just not engaging. Again it is probably my tastes but when you are a foot away from your enemy and it says miss,is just not for me. Rolling and chances and all this is just makes combat dull. I honestly don't know if I am willing to push through what is a very engaging game otherwise, as any time a combat scenario occurs, my engagement just drops. Hopefully it gets better, but this is from of fighting mechanics that is too slow and not engaging at all. But again the sheer choice, story flexibility and world building is epic. I hope if I stick with it and it clicks like it hasfor others.",0.06
"Baldur's Gate 3: Uma aventura épica repleta de magia, mistério e escolhas cativantes",0.1
Can't understand all the 10s... definitely a well made game but it has nothing new for the genre... just an exponential amplification of what has already been seen... extremely slow and dialogue based... if you don't love the genre it certainly won't be this game to change your mind... far from what I would call a masterpiece,0.06
Everything is super slow. I become afraid of skirmishing of any appearing creature because it was just so slowing down the story. The hidden things are really hidden as you need to go with the old pixel by pixel thing to find sg just in 3D and constantly rotating the screen. The dices make you feel that you have some chance to solve anything but it just won't happen every time and if you don't save before every dice roll it makes you take extremely difficult paths compared to that if you simly had luck.,0.03
""" absolutely love playing the game Baldur's Gate 3! It's so engaging that I can restart it a hundred times and still have fun with new characters and different choices. The game's treatment of characters based on their race and the decisions made is impressive. It's a game that my family members and I played together, and we had a blast! The character development is phenomenal, and I have even introduced it to friends who have never played Dungeons and Dragons or video games before, and they were thoroughly ecstatic. Baldur's Gate 3 takes DnD-based games to the next level.",0.1

"I usually don't like turned based games and find them sometimes boring but then I played BG3 and found it one of my favorite game to play.

"While Act 3 felt a little rushed, the game is a masterpiece. I do prefer DOS:2 combat over Baldur's Gate 3 simply because it's not 'D&amp;D 5e, but better.'

"It feels impossible that this game even exists.  It is one of the first branching path games where the paths actually branch and the decisions actually feel like they matter.  The open ended combat is incredible.  I'm not a huge fan of turn based crpg combat normally, but BG3 has done what I thought was impossible.  They made it engaging and fun.  The game is constantly being updated in meaningful ways by the devs, at a speed usually unheard of.  The first 2 acts of the game are basically perfect in every way.  Act 3 is still a bit rough around the edges, but only in the sense that it isn't perfect like the first 2 acts.  In comparison to just about every other RPG out their, even the third act is pure gold.",0.1

Otherwise keep away from it, and if you like RPG games, just go with action RPG like final fantasy.",0.06
"It's a great game, but playing on a console is frustrating. They should have tried harder to to make it work with a keyboard and mouse. Autosave needs to happen more as well. I spent so long redoing sections because of bugs or surprises that locked me into a fight I couldn't win. Still a lot of annoying bugs 7 months after launch. Act 3 is a slogfest.",0.08

"The game's sprawling open-world design can lead to moments of aimless wandering, as players struggle to find direction amidst the vastness of the game world, because of the lack of great map design. Additionally, the narrative pacing can feel uneven at times, with certain story arcs dragging on while others feel rushed or underdeveloped, such as the start of the game was rushed. As a new person to the series, I had no idea where is where. They just jumped into the game. After an hour of slow, boring, gameplay I just stopped playing. This game got goty, because of the nudity, the gore, and the romance in it. This game should have his own title. Its unfair to bring a romance simulator with nudes, onto the gaming industry, of course this game is gonna win everything expect, Best Art Direction, Best Narrative, and Best Game Direction. Because this game has no art, no narrative, and no direction. A ""game"" where you can design the private parts of your character is not a game. Its an overhyped Romance Novel.",0.0

The combat is fun with a number of different ways of approaching boss fights and different difficulty settings allow you to customize the experience to your skill level.

Also all this ppl saying this is a good game according to steam only 20% of players finished the game, 38% finished act 2, and 50% finished act 1 so i mean what are you talking about you dont even played the game ( dont have other platform stats but i cant see far from steam ones).",0.07

"Baldur's Gate 3 é, sem dúvida nenhuma, e com folga, a melhor conversão de um RPG de mesa para um jogo eletrônico.É difícil dizer algo sobre Baldur's Gate 3 a essa altura que já não tenham dito, então vou analisá-lo baseado na minha experiência.O jogo eletrônico mais próximo que eu joguei de um RPG de mesa tinha sido Disco Elysium, que apesar de ser mais baseado em texto é um jogo incrível. Já Baldur's Gate 3 não traz apenas textos, mas “todo o tabuleiro e seus acessórios” para o mundo digital, com cutscenes e cinemáticas de tirar o fôlego (+ de 170 horas delas), mundos abertos e batalhas de turno, tudo baseado no universo de Dungeons &amp; Dragons (se você já jogou D&amp;D você “estará em casa”). Eu nunca joguei um RPG de mesa (por falta de oportunidade) e agora fiquei com vontade de jogar. Você tem um nível de liberdade em Baldur's Gate 3 que eu jamais vi em nenhum outro jogo. Após criar o seu personagem como quiser e passar pela “fase tutorial”, você meio que pode fazer qualquer coisa, moralmente correta ou não. Ninguém é invulnerável no jogo, nem os NPCs de vilarejos, independente da raça, sexo ou idade. Você pode literalmente tacar o terror se quiser, mas tenha em mente que você terá que arcar com as **** interações com seres e NPCs costumam ser bem imersivas, alternando o ângulo de câmera conforme você dialoga com eles. Os personagens possuem gráficos e expressões bem realistas para um jogo desse tipo. Dá uma surra no “Star30”. Algumas escolhas de diálogos você vai precisar rolar dados e ter uma pontuação mínima para concretizá-la, e o êxito disso vai depender muito dos atributos do seu personagem e do seu grupo. Embora pareça que é só nos diálogos que você faz a rolagem os dados, todo o background do jogo funciona assim, principalmente nos combates. Por exemplo: Atacou um inimigo e tirou 6 de dano? Você pode consultar o log de batalhas e ver as rolagens que ocorreram e que fizeram você tirar 6 de **** combates deste jogo merecem um destaque a parte, mesmo comparado a outros RPGs com combates em turno.Começando pela trilha sonora, que em muitos combates são soberbas, aquelas músicas épicas com corais, transformando combates triviais em verdadeiros eventos heróicos. E não pense que em todos os combates você só vai escolher o que cada personagem do seu grupo vai fazer e depois só assistir. Muitos inimigos podem te surpreender no meio de um turno de tal maneira que você pode simplesmente não jogar o próximo.Então antes de algumas batalhas você precisa bolar uma estratégia de ataque e defesa. Você é livre para ir somente na “porrada” se quiser, mas sua vida se tornará um inferno em algumas batalhas, mesmo jogando no modo “Explorador” (Fácil).Baldur's Gate 3 também se tornou o RPG de turno com a maior duração de batalhas em turno que eu já joguei na vida. Algumas delas demorando de 40 a 60 minutos (sem reload de save). E é extremamente gratificante quando você ganha uma batalha dessas, mesmo se não tiver nenhuma recompensa aparente.Embalando o recorde acima ele fez outro: o de maior quantidade de inimigos para se enfrentar em uma única batalha de turno. Em alguma situações você poderá enfrentar mais de 40 inimigos de uma vez. Os “cards” dos inimigos preenchem a parte superior da tela e ainda aparece um (+25) do lado, porque não couberam todos. Então imagine você, com quatro personagens no grupo, tendo que enfrentar uma legião inteira? This is Sparta!Outro aspecto que eu nunca tinha visto em nenhum outro jogo é o suporte ao controle. “Mas dá para jogar no controle?” você deve perguntar. E aqui eu preciso bater palmas  para o Larian Studios. Quando você joga com o controle, não pense que ele vai apenas trocar os layouts dos botões: os desenvolvedores construíram um HUD inteiro totalmente focado para quem joga no controle (até porque o jogo seria lançado nos consoles), e essa adaptação ficou incrivelmente bem feita.Jogando no PC, você pode alternar entre controle e teclado/mouse quando quiser. Todo o HUD se adapta. Confesso que ambas opções ficaram tão bem feitas que eu não sabia com qual jogar. No final, acabei optando pelo controle, porque você consegue mover o personagem livremente no mapa e dar zoom, transformando um jogo originalmente isométrico em terceira pessoa. Já no teclado você move os personagens clicando onde eles devem ir, só conseguindo dar zoom. Mas no teclado, você tem uma opção que ajuda muito que é pesquisar o nome de um item e descobrir em qual inventário ele está, algo que não tem no controle. Enfim, cabe a você testar ambos, avaliar os prós e contras de cada e decidir com qual jogar.",0.1

"Masterpiece, a new reference in the genre and really unique. If you haven't played party based RPGS or DND and would like to get a sample try this one, it's a blast to play. Story-wise the game is brilliant. You progress story through the main quests but really fill the gaps and expand through sides and exploration. The world is telling you a story of its own, and it's so cool to go out there and discover it. Decisions matter, and they will greatly influence your playthrough. Origin characters are really charismatic and interesting to play with, I loved having them around. The same can be said for lots of the secondary characters. The VAs are amazing, they really live the characters.Graphics and settings/levels are amazing, it is so immersive. The music and sounds are really good too, I hope they had added more voiced tracks like the one in the ""House of Hope"".Building your own custom character while being able to respec easily at any moment is a joy. I really like the mechanics, rests/ spells / equipment etc. It was really cool to build my party over time, unlock abilities, use new equipment and strategies, mastering the party gameplay over time. You build your own strategy and feel it like your own, as well as how you carve your path. Agency feeling is high on this one.I like how chaotic, complex and unpredictable the game can be. If you've played outer wilds, this one also has that feeling of accompiishment when you discover how something works, or how to smartly play an encounter. For the curious and picky, it's wonderful. You will be rewarded for going the extra **** the final mission, I dislike how ally help is implemented. You need to call on them per fight, and waste an action doing so. It is quite discouraging to the point I barely used it. I would have strongly preferred allies to show up along the way as you progress through it if you have that ally available.Inventory management is a bit of a mess, and there are many things that shouldn't be there. Why do I want food in my inventory? It's useless, I just want it to go to camp for me to be able to long rest effectively. Also, I'd like to have more distinctive bags to put stuff in (Scroll bag, weapons bag...). I missed some important mechanics due to the game not telling you about them, like the possibility of going to camp mostly at any time or the idea of sending all food to camp since it is only useless there and it weighs quite a lot making you encumbered often (PS: Karlach is a good mule). I dislike how the game makes you feel a bit too much urgency at first, thorugh cinematics that are kinda encouraging you to take haste even though you can rest as many times as needed. It made my first act more difficult as I was trying not to waste spells. You may skip some cutscenes because you didn't long rest at that precise location too.A tip, don't hesitate to use scrolls, potions, elixirs and such. I had the typical need of hoarding them to be used ""in the future"" and ended up by not using most. Make use of the resources at **** game leaves me with a feeling of mastery of my particular party, but with an urge to try out other combinations and learn about different paths and strategies. Also, can't wait for Steam Workshop support. This game will greatly benefit from modding. Act 3 still has some bugs that need to be addressed and some things were left unfinished (infernal iron?).Looking forward to play this coop at some point, if you are looking for an adventure look no further.",0.1

The writing is also atrocious and contrived, although no less than I would expect based on other Larian titles. They are the kings of cringe in that department.

Scrolling the inventory with tons of useless stuff is pain, camera is pain, choosing the right scroll is headache cause of reading descriptions over and over again.

"In my opinion Baldur's Gate III is that kind of RPG where you find all necessary elements to fully experiment a game masterpiece. Of course Baldur's Gate III is not a perfect game and there always will be things which can be improved but nevertheless this game is a real piece of art. I love how much attention the creative team paid to all game details such: the graphic design of characters and environment; the characters features, expressions and their voices fully performed by artists; the rich story and history of the Faerûn realm; the complexity of the plot, main quest and other side missions; and last but not the least, the wonderful  music score of the game, one of the best game soundtracks ever made. My rating for each section of the game is this: Gameplay: 4.6 / 5; Story: 4.5 / 5; Characters: 4.8 / 5; Video: 4.6 / 5; Audio: 4.5 / 5; User Interface: 4.7 / 5.",0.09

"I have mixed feelings about this game. I played the first two parts of Baldur's Gate back in the day, but this game doesn't give me that Baldur's Gate feeling. Maybe it's because of the mediocre story, the poor character introduction or the obsessive adherence to old RPG mechanics. I'm not a DND player, but I am at least a passionate board gamer. Nevertheless, I can't understand why the DND system had to be implemented so precisely. It's a CRPG after all, and I play it because I don't want to roll dice. The inventory is overflowing with useless stuff, 35 longswords, longsword +1 and then maybe a legendary variant with a completely negligible attribute. It feels like it makes no difference at all. The spells are boring, the combat mechanics are uninteresting and tedious, the limited camera perspective is annoying to say the least. I admit, the way spells, environment and weapons can be combined is creative and fun, but that was already in Divinity: Original Sins 2 and it was more fun there because you weren't slowed down by the limitations of the DND system. There are often many ways to solve a situation, but I still feel like I'm on rails. I really have to force myself to keep playing because neither itemization, story nor character development give me any incentive.",0.06

"Baldur's Gate 3 is a remarkably polished game, offering a very solid experience. While it may not break new ground, its attention to detail and refinement set a new standard in RPGs. From its intricate storytelling to its strategic combat, it delivers an immersive journey for players seeking depth and challenge. In my opinion, it's simply a very well-executed game where we'll spend many enjoyable hours.",0.09

I don't understand the need for such an unhealthy focus on sex in a video game.",0.06

"Gaming is on a downhill. I started the game and got no tutorial, nothing. Character creation was more about, private parts, than anything else... I start the game and the cut scenes had no sound, only the ship, and other things. Nobody was talking. The game is slow. Walking 20 meters is 6-7 rounds... of course the game is very long... The map is the worst i ever saw in games... i was walking around and around.... My character died after stepped in a small amount of ember... This game is the lowest of lows... A romance simulator.... with useless gore... it was not good and pointless. Everything was gore and nothing was looking good. Alan Wake 2 was really good, did the horror, the gore in a different way than any other game... Yet it does not have any nudes, and its only on Epic so people start hating it while they didn't even tried it out. I was shocked about why only epic so i started searching. The cost of the game was 80 mil... Epic founded it... Its that easy. If no epic = no Alan Wake 2. That game made me fell in love with the Remedy Universe. And Alan Wake 2 is the GOTY for 2023.",0.0

"Best implementation of the tabletop RPG mechanics. For a game with this much complexity, unbelievable acting and voicing. Very good environmental design, and a pretty good story. Game has bugs and implementation issues, especially at the Act 3 and the change of scenery and pace is probably not for everyone, but it is okay. Definitely recommend.",0.09
No microtransactions is half the score for me. But this also has a really intriguing story and deep gameplay. Voice acting is on point. I wish they wouldn’t have pandered to “you know who” so much but it’s near impossible to get a game that isn’t forced to push some “woke” agenda these days. Would’ve been a 10/10 otherwise.,0.09

"Absolutely amazing game which is  a worthy continuation of legendary BG1 and BG2 which i loved and play as a young teenager. I just finished my first playthrough and I have enjoyed it all the way through. Game is huge. I have tried to visit every corner and finish every quest and it took me 220 hours to do it. But it never gets boring. Main story is amazing and you are really making it your own based on decisions you take during playthrough. Sidequests are entertaining and engaging. There was not a moment when I felt like doing chores. I have two things which I would prefer differently though...: 1. Lack of party members and small party - only 4 party members give you very little space for experimenting and varying your set up. 2. Max level is only level 12 which doesn't give you access to most powerful and interresting spells and skills. Also, as a veteran of genre, which I probably am as I played many D&amp;D type games, I made a mistake of picking balanced difficulty. Well, it was really easy. Only one ""hard"" fight in game was Raphael, but still fell on first try. And for example dragon Ansur didn't even get a turn. Strategical element of game was kind of non-existent due to it being so easy. And things like buffing are totally useless on balanced difficulty. Also kind of non-existent in game. Concentration during most of buffing spells I didn't really like neither, but ok, it is what it is. But none of my complaints are game breaking or preventing people from fully enoying beautiful and engaging story. It really does not have competition in this genre regarding quality of visuals and voice acting. Also, lower difficulty and simplified rules are great for people with no experience in genre. It is really easy to get into playing BG3 even if you have no clue what D&amp;D is about. I see here some negative reviews regarding story or lack of tutorial - even probably written by same person under different accounts. Well, it is absolute BS. If someone says that story is missing, then it is absolute delusional idiot. And if you can't figure out how to play this in like 1 hour tops, then stay away from any game which requires at least slight use of brain forever. King of the genre stays for me convincingly Pathfinder: WoTR. And in terms of game mechanics I also prefer other games, like for example Pillars of Eternity, Neverwinter nights or even Divinity Original Sin. But in terms of perfect storytelling, Baldur's Gate 3 has no equal and it is absolutely worth playing. I will play definitely again, although I will pump my difficullty up.",0.09
"This is a masteThis is a masterpiece. The last word must be said from the beginning. It might be the best game I've ever played. Frankly, I didn't like the cinematics released in the last year and I didn't have high expectations, but Larian proved me wrong. It's incredible that such a small-scale Studio can achieve such great quality work! It was a real source of surprise and happiness, especially after the recent disappointing works of the big Studios (such as Diablo 4). Thank you Larian, they are now on par with Blizzard North for me...rpiece.",0.1

"Very good game. What's amazing is that Larian Studios created the game knowing that players may not even know about 20% of the content. Thus, individual approaches to games become original. We also have many character classes to choose from, which also significantly influence the game. To be honest, when I bought the game I was confused and unsure about its great ratings.

And i’ve never seen such game could offer this much creativity in gameplay. U can basically do anything u can imagine. And the turn-based combat system was new to me so i had a tiny bit of hard time at first but after a few hours i’m so hooked and atm i’m on another playthrough to try other classes and ending.

"BG3: The biggest surprise for me in YEARS. I knew nothing about this game before it came out. The only reason I heard about it is because it was getting such positive buzz, and it was all deserved. I’ve spent hundreds of hours in this immersive story. From the characters, to the story, to the exploration, this game blows every other RPG out of the water. This game released around the same time as Starfield and it made me realize how boring Starfield is and made me forget about playing it. You can choose from so many different classes and every little decision you make matters. This is honestly probably the game of the generation, and Larian keeps improving it constantly.

A few downsides though, the last act is slightly buggy and much less work than the first two. I felt like I was doing quests without really understanding them sometimes. No day/night cycles (yet present on BG2). Sometimes a little strange interactions (especially in the last act). And then a recruitable character who arrives very late in the game and who has difficulty integrating into the story. In short, the game is very good but will be even better with the release of corrective patches ;) Completed in 80 hours.",0.1

"On December 7 I looked at Baldurs Gate 3 as the game that stole the game of the year award from Spider-Man 2. I continued to view it like this for the days to come but slowly my interest started to increase. If this game won game of the year it had to be good. Only the greatest of games gain the privilege to acquired the prestigious game of the year award. Finally on December 27 2023 I purchased Baldurs Gate 3. After 50 hours of gameplay let me tell you, this isn’t a game, this is an experience no… this is a phenomenon. Something that emerges every once in decades that shape the gaming industry for the rest of existence. This game is the culmination of everything Larian Studios have learned over the years of game development to craft the ultimate experience. Fun fact the wait for Baldurs Gate 3 was longer that the wait for GTA 6. Baldurs gate 2 released in the year 2000. It took them 23 years to gain the knowledge and ability the craft this, and it was worth it. The advances in gameplay that this game offers are beyond anything conceivable before this. The turned based combat that this game, sorry, this phenomenon offers is nothing short of perfection. Every race, class, and subclass offers unique gameplay that makes this game replay able for the rest of your life. Like the decisions you make actually matter. Games before have tried this when they say, “your decisions impact the gameplay”. Hogwash, they don’t actually matter but this phenomenon actually does that providing that level of gameplay to you. Each run through of the game will be completely different. This is a true adventure. And I haven’t even completed act 1. That is insane. I have put 37 hours into my regular run and I haven’t even completed 1/3 of the game. That is insane. The remaining hours have gone into other runs with the gang that are the funnest times I’ve ever had. It’s so funny when me and my friends make our characters look goofy as heck and running around like we own the world. That’s another thing, the character creator. Nearly millions of different combinations came be crafted using this intricate system. Holy crap if I compared the story of Spider-Man 2 to the Bible it’s only right that I compare this game to the story of life itself, now and the rest of time. If I’m saying this and I haven’t even finished act 1 I can’t wait to see what happens in act 2 and 3. This game deserved game of the year and I am not afraid to say that this is the best phenomenon that I have ever experienced. I’m sorry Spider-Man, maybe next time. Thank you if you read this entire thing and I hope you have a good day, and please if you have the opportunity to, play Baldurs Gate 3, do it. Final score, infinity out of 10 I don’t even care if that’s allowed this game deserves it.",0.1
"Upon acquiring Baldur's Gate 3, my initial expectations were unclear, guided mainly by friends' recommendations and its recognition as the 2023 Game of the Year. Having a background in tabletop DND, I was familiar with concepts like rolling for initiative and turn-based combat, which appealed to my preference for turn-based strategy games. What pleasantly surprised me, however, was the exceptional quality of the story and **** depth of dialogue and information provided for each NPC is remarkable. Random NPCs offer hints for upcoming missions, and the order in which you tackle quests yields diverse outcomes. Noteworthy is the attention to detail, evident in actions like reading looted books that can unlock unique dialog options with main and side characters. BG3 is a testament to the meticulous effort the game studio invested in its **** enthusiasts of lengthy story campaigns, intricate characters, and replay value, this game is a gem. Although multiplayer is an option for up to three others, I suggest limiting it to two players to avoid hindering story progression with main side characters that are required to be in your party to progress. The audio design is superb, complemented by top-notch visuals, showcasing what a game studio can achieve when not fixated on **** of now, I've invested approximately 120 hours into the game, juggling three different storylines—solo and with friends. While I'm yet to complete the game, I am already certain that Baldur's Gate 3 will continue to captivate me. It stands as a testament to immersive gaming, free from the distractions of microtransactions. Simply put, grab it and thank yourself later.",0.1

"This is a really good enjoyable game. It is very well designed. It looks fantastic with really interesting areas that are exciting to explore with quests that never feel **** writing is really fantastic and well done in this game with very good well written characters that aren't 1 dimensional. I absolutely love RPG games that have a lot of depth, choices and content.  I can do many playthroughs.This game helps to fill the hole of the deep narrative RPG that Bioware was once good for. As Biowares recent games after being aquired by EA lack the depth **** RPG and instead have been average open world games with lacklustre meaningless fetch quests.I just hope EA doesn't buy out Larian. As any studio they buy become soulless zombie shells of their former selves.I abosultely love Raphael's Song. It's such a creative touch to the game.There are things I dislike though. Inventory management is terrible and annoying, every item has weight even gold, keys, paper and potions so you are limited to what you can carry. Most other games don't put weight on currency, keys and potions. I didn't realise at first why my character was encumbered as was hardly carrying anything until I checked that the 10k of gold I was carrying was what was encumbering **** is also a bit buggy. Long rest often doesn't work unless you have at least 40  camp supply in your inventory for it to work and doesn't seem to acknowledge camp supplies in the camp chest.I did not have any crashing. But the game does have bugs. Such as was trying to destroy a crumbling wall and the character on a swing and hit ended up behind the wall stuck on the other side and the wall was not destroyed yet and was just stuck in **** annoyingly for some reason Lazael stopped following me even though she's chained but when I control her everyone follows her, it happens with various party members occasionally. Closing and restarting the game seems to fix it.Another annoying thing is when I had Halsin in my party transformed to an owlbear after the shadowed spirit of the land fight  he totally obliterates any cutscenes so all you see is this massive white blob of an owlbear taking up the entire screen and you can't see anything else in a cutscene or dialogue screen and you also end up inside the owlbear seeing these massive freaky golden orb eyes. So I don't have him in my party anymore. This probably happens with any druids in your party that are shapeshifted and it needs to be fixed.I also dislike that you can't see the spells and skills of those in your camp and can only see them when they are in your party. It's annoying having to switch out just to be able to see those.Romances are poorly done and forced onto you from just being friendly and nice.Bioware did romances a lot **** 1 is done very well, the pacing and exploring is spot on. Act 2 was suspenseful but a bit dull. Act 3 felt different, it is chaotic, overwhelming, too busy and all over the place. It  feels like they tried to cram everything into act 3 and it would of been better if they had more acts and spaced things out more.  I thought the ending was good enough and I liked the ****'s still a good game, but no where as good or as amazing as people make out.I try and explore every nook and cranny and my first playthrough took me over 200 hours as As I  wasted so much time opening every crate and barrel I come across.Because of chaotic act 3  and  bugs I can't rate the game higher.",0.08

"I love Dungeons &amp; Dragons, However, this game felt, boring and slow. I'm used to play, turn based games, but this one was boring. Any other game such as Shadowrun: Dragonfall is just so exciting to play. I played Baldur's Gate 3 for an hour and nothing happened. I was being bored the whole time. The cut scenes are built up on cliche. For example: A plane, that's been going down with many explosions, what you escape just in time, where you land in the unknown.... I'm seeing the same problem here, with Overwatch 2. The Game doesn't show you, nor tell you anything. This loses the ""fun"" part of the game. I was lost many times, and because of this bad map design, I was walking around the map clueless. The Game is full of gore, and pornographic scenes... This is why people in the 80' said that Dungeons &amp; Dragons is bad for the children. And this is why the game is famous. This game robbed Alan Wake 2 from the Game Of The Year Award. Alan Wake 2 is this years, best game. A game with a dark tone, with beautiful graphics, and with a brilliant narrative. And with 0 pornographic scenes! This Game, Baldur's Gate 3 is an over hyped Ren'Py Visual Novel Game. Do me a favour, and play Alan Wake 2, and see what this ""game"" robbed.",0.0

"Enjoyed the character creator but everything goes downhill fast from there. No opening hook, a glacial story pace that genuinely feels boring, and characters whose interactions feel incredibly overhyped. DnD mechanics make for irritating combat, general lack of well written lore, this game is a mess. Don’t get me started on all its bugs.",0.02
"As someone who doesn't play turned based games and DnD, I was blown away by how many hours I've sunken into this game. The FREEDOM that the game let's you do is amazing and I love the dice roll mechanics to change the outcome of what happens to the quests and story. I can already imagine the replay value this game has, I've played a lot of skyrim with many different classes and never got bored doing the same quests, Baldurs gate 3 takes it to a whole other level when you develop relationships with npcs. Astarion, Karlach and Shadowheart are companions that I absolutely adore. All the hype from this game got me **** in and I do not regret it one bit. It is truly a breathtaking game that redefines the RPG genre. Game of the Decade without a doubt. There are just too many words for me to come up with to justify this masterpiece. It is truly a title that deserves all its praise and its studio, staff and voice actors. If you haven't played it, don't think, just get the game, you will be instantly hooked on it this is an experience that should never be missed.",0.1
"I played this game in a very old laptop and I have to say this game is so unbelievably optimized that I can run the game. With that out of the way I've always wanted a game that truly would let you do whatever you want and this game is that. There's several times that I thought it would be funny if I could do ""this"" and the game would just let me. I love this game, its characters and its story.",0.1

"One of the best games I have played of all time. The RPG mechanics in this game are perfect with so many impactful choices to choose from and character and quest arcs to explore. The overall gameplay takes so time getting used to but once you get used to it, it does feel amazing especially when you level and gear up your characters. It does feel great to see the progression of your characters both story and gameplay wise. All the acts are amazing and they each get better after the other. Music, voice acting and animations are a bit buggy. Finding loot or cool items in this game is the best it has ever felt due to the fact that you have 4 or more characters to gear up with so many ways you can actually play the game. Areas and enemies are also very diverse as well. The only critiques I have for this game is that it can be slightly buggy at times and you cannot backtrack to previous areas in previous acts- would have been cool to revisit some areas especially to see how they would have changed with the story but overall it is understandable why they did this. Overall a masterpiece.",0.1

"After 82 hours, I have just finished my first playthrough of Baldur's Gate 3, and let me start by saying that I will probably never experience an RPG like the third Baldur again.I'll start with how my adventure with this game began. As a fan of RPG games even before the release of BG3, I knew that a series such as Baldur's Gate existed, but I had never played it because I was not born yet when the first two parts were released. I wasn't interested in Dungeons &amp; Dragons either, so I was completely new to turn-based RPGs. I knew about BG3, but I wasn't interested at all because I had never played a turn-based RPG and I said it wasn't for me.Well, I said so until I decided to buy Baldur's Gate 3. Encouraged by the good reviews of the game, I decided to buy **** what can I say, it was one of the best gaming decisions I've ever made.During the first hours I was learning the entire turn-based RPG system, but after a few hours the game was so enjoyable that I couldn't stop playing. The turn-based combat system, which at the beginning was the main reason that turned me off from this game, turned out to be one of the game's greatest advantages.There are so many possibilities for customizing combat that it's unimaginable. It's a total sandbox where you can do whatever comes to your mind.Moving on to the general part of the game, there is nothing to criticize about Baldur's Gate 3. This game does everything perfectly. Hundreds, or even thousands, of dialogue choices that completely change the course of your adventure. Perfect character creator that allows you to create the character you want (in addition, there are numerous mods that add new visual things such as faces, hairstyles, clothes, armor, etc., I highly recommend installing)As I wrote at the beginning, it took me 82 hours to complete the game for the first time, which is completely unique when it comes to single-player games. Moreover, during these 82 hours, I never once felt bored or tired from **** even after finishing the game for the first time, I already want to play it again, with a new hero with a new class and subclass, with new companions and with new choices throughout the entire plot that will radically change its course.I could go on and on about the positives of this game, but there's just too **** sum up, Baldur's Gate 3 turned out to be my dream RPG game that I had always been waiting for.",0.1
"Ugly, stupid and riddled with cliche. The animations in the cutscenes, the armor, the plot, the choices, the companions, all of it is of the lowest level. The worst choice is to give the making of the third part **** series to the Larians. In the end we have what we have - a visual generic harem fanfic",0.0

"The impact of Baldur's Gate on my gaming experience has been profound, altering my perspective in ways I never anticipated. It has transformed my preferences, showcasing a level of depth in choices, dialogues, and decisions that I had never encountered before. With over 100 hours invested in this masterpiece, I can confidently say that I've never witnessed anything comparable. The precision of the choices presented is awe-inspiring, leaving me in a state of perpetual astonishment. I find myself reluctant for the game to conclude, dreading the return to a world saturated with uninspiring titles like Diablo 4 and Ubisoft games, which pale in comparison.Larian, thank you. My attachment to this game is profound, and I intend to carry it with me beyond the realms of gaming. Elden Ring and BG3 stand as the transformative pillars in my gaming journey. The ability to form emotional connections with characters, remember NPCs, and genuinely care about every word, place, and detail is a testament to the unparalleled craftsmanship of this game. In short, words fall short to express my gratitude for the experience you've bestowed upon ****'ve irreversibly influenced the gaming industry, setting a standard that rejects mediocre and hollow creations. I cherish the profound impact you've had on my gaming life, and for that, I extend my heartfelt thanks.",0.1

"I've been in this game since last week. This is overall the best game I've played since I started gaming back in 1991. I've played a fair amount of turn-based games, I still playeverything else, from racing sims to fighters, from $5,- Indies to massive 3D open world games, but BG3 is just like the golden standard above anything else. I can't even describe what this game is to me. Like it's made by over-enthusiastic video game lovers with a big love for **** something? I'm not going to go in detail. Litterally every second is a fest.",0.1

"TLDR: A masterpiece on the first run, if you want to experience the classic hero story. 10/10 on first playthrough. 7/10 afterwards. GOOD: - Combat system. Many spells with epic realisation in effect design and synchro. Hearing Gale yell ""IGNIS!"" doesn't get boring even after 100 times.- Enemy variety. Especially the fights against creatures are all unique. You never fight a creature twice. This makes exploring the game on the first run super exciting. Unfortunately, the fights against humanoids are all the more frequent. In the third act in particular, I would have liked to have seen more recurring enemies from the first act.- Heroic story. The story for the classic good playthrough is very well told and logical. You start your journey as a small but potential hero and truly become a saviour. If your role fits better, the game experience feels even better. Heal-Barde was it for me.- Dungeons. There are only a few recurring dungeon themes. Many are very individual and it is great fun to explore them and find out which enemies are lurking within.- Equipment. Never have I played a game with such exciting equipment. You don't feel much of it at first, but the further you progress, the more specialised the equipment becomes. It doesn't just boost stats, but contributes to your individual play style.- Characters. Most of the NPCs are very likeable. Especially those who **** at the beginning undergo a great development. Laezel and Shadowheart are very annoying at first. But Shadowheart probably has the most elaborate background story of all. Laezel's development is rather predictable, but still nice to watch. Karlach's story is simple, but all the harder. Gael and Astarion are super likeable time companions. I even prefer Gael to the fan favourite vampire. His wisdom and knowledge regularly contribute to the worldbuilding and his dubbing is in no way inferior to that of Astarion. But the best character by far is the devil Raphael. Halsin, on the other hand, became a joke character after the first act, who would have been better suited to a harem game and became very intrusive.- Class system. Hammer, despite all the overlap.- Boss fights. Every boss feels unique. That's exactly how it should be.AVERAGE:- Dialogues + story. The writing is very erratic. Sometimes it's top-notch, sometimes it feels like it was written by an inexperienced teenager. In general, the story is very stereotypical. There are no plot twists and almost every character fulfils their clichés. In a game with this much flexibility and freedom, this is probably the necessary sacrifice. The genius lies in the details. No matter what you choose to do, it feels like you're experiencing the real story. And there are big differences. But since the story itself is so inconsequential, I can't rate it as ****:- Bad story. The game pretends that there is a bad story. In my subsequent playthroughs, I tried to experience the bad story. In the first act, you are presented with a ridiculously terrible decision. Except that the evil story ends abruptly. Act 2 treats the player as a double agent throughout. You are not allowed to become an evil identity. You can only indulge in your lust for murder as Dark Urge, without any direct connection to the story. And with that, the game's genius disintegrates into hypocrisy. There is only one story. Decisions only have selective weight.",0.09

"Just like Star Wars in 1977 changed our expectations of what cinema was capable of, Baldur’s Gate 3 is a “lightning in a bottle” cultural moment that is likely to change how we look at what is even possible in video games. The sheer depth and bravery of design, the utter attention to detail in both plot and gameplay mechanics, the freedom to create completely new outcomes and stories with each individual play through (which incidentally I’m on my third of at the moment with hundreds of hours of play), it’s simply phenomenal. As is the respect with which it treats its audience, I might hasten to add. And why do games like this come around so rarely? Because it is unbelievably rare to find a studio like Larian who will go so far out on a limb and expose themselves so publicly and financially to purchase a licence for a little-known and little cared-about franchise (outside the mainstream pap that is FPS and football games), and turn it into the immense success that this game is, through their hard work, willpower and love. No Sony, no Nintendo, no other major gaming software house or developer can do this because none of them will expose themselves to the financial risks involved. That’s the price for “lightning in a bottle”. You’ve got to have the guts to seize that lightning in your bare hands and cram it into the bloody bottle! Nobody cared about sci-fi fantasy in the mainstream before George Lucas came along. There were just niche enthusiasts who were into authors like Arthur C Clarke, Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov. Swen Vincke is the new George Lucas of video games. I salivate at the prospects of games like Neverwinter Nights 3 (Empire Strikes Back!) or Divinity Original Sin 3 (Return of the Jedi!) to come yet. And just like when Star Wars came out in 1977, there are lots of people saying the equivalent of “Huh, I don’t get it, why is that man shiny? Why can they move things just by thinking? I don’t get it! I don’t like it!” That’s fine, it’s ok. You don’t have to like it. There’s COD and FC24 over there, just for people like you and of course…there’s always Spider-Man 2…if you rolled a natural one when it comes to the imagination stakes, that’s none of my business! We’ll just keep enjoying the greatest game ever made over here, while “you do you”, and the rest of humanity plays this wonderful, wonderful video game, over and over and over again. Everyone involved in this game’s production is a hero in my eyes, whether they set out to be or not, and that is in essence what the game harnessed by buying the Dungeons and Dragons licence. We can all be heroes.",0.1

"I honestly don't even need to leave a review but I will consider this my love letter to Baldur's Gate 3, and even more to Larian for the incredible work they have put into this game. People talk about technical issues and glitches but don't understand that these are issues actively being fixed every day. The amount of hotfixes and bonus content Larian studios has given to us is unthinkable before BG3. Baldur's Gate 3 is an epic story with rich script and dynamic reactions to how you the player decide to act in the world. For people to be so mad that it swept the awards category is laughable. I knew back when I played Divinity Original Sins 2 that Larian was going to do something even greater one day but for them to turn out this masterpiece was unthinkable. To say you don't like BG3 is like saying outright you are unempathetic unable to attach yourself to a beautiful dynamic realistic world of angst and beauty . We will not get another game like this in a very long time. Unless Larian decides to suprise us again.",0.1

One of the best RPGs of all time and well deserving of Game of the Year 2023. Baldur's Gate 3 tells a compelling story matched with an extensive campaign that allows a great deal of player agency and includes some of the most well-written characters in any video game. This easily delivers hundreds if not thousands of hours of content for any player that's engaged (which is incredibly easy to be with this game).

"Baldur's Gate 3 is seriously epic! The gameplay is 10/10, and the storyline is like a rollercoaster of emotions. I got hooked on the characters. The turn-based combat is intense, makes you really think about your moves. And the best part? Your choices actually matter. The quests are wild, and the dialogue options keep you on your toes. It's like classic RPG vibes, but with a modern twist.",0.1

"Genuinely one of my favorite games of all time.  It's well written, the voice acting is amazing, and the combat is pretty fun.  It does have a couple issues here and there, but Larian is actively working to bug fix and to improve the original product.  It's amazing now, and will only get better with time!",0.09

"this is the greatest RPG i have ever played. i am 90 hours in, and I'm not even close to bored. a must play for any RPG fan. the combat and gameplay is spectacular and groundbreaking, incredibly revolutionary. anyone who says it is slow is wrong. if you don't like turn based combat, you wont like this game, and thats fine. but calling the gameplay bad because its turn based is just stupid. this is the best turn based combat I've played, very few flaws. the story and characters are incredible, and the side quests are not treated like chores with boring stories you don't give a **** about (cough cough skyrim). the dialogue heavily effects the world and characters around you, and there are so many features that really let you carve out your own unique playstyle. leveling up is kind of satisfying, but it could have been better. especially if you're playing a melee class, leveling up doesn't really do much. plus the music only has around two stand out tracks (Down By The River and Raphael's Final Act) and the rest are pretty forgettable. every bit of dialogue, even with random ass merchants is motion captured, so you NEVER get the Ubisoft/Bethesda NPC stare. the NPCs feel much more alive than in any other game. Act 3 has had some bugs, but they are constantly being fixed and I have only experienced minor visual bugs. Larian is constantly updating and supporting this game because they are a great developer. if you have a PC that can run it, and the spare cash you have no excuse NOT to get this game.",0.1

"I went into this game skeptical even with the critically acclaimed reviews because it was a turn-based game. I have to say first of This is one of the best games I have ever played. The story has many different layers and complexities that keep the game interesting. The amount of choice that is in this game is crazy and makes for high level of replayability. The combat grew on me battles were engaging and fun and kept me thinking about what my next move was going to be. This game will define rpgs going forward. The game is not perfect, but the game deserves a 10 out of 10 and I look forward to what larian studios will do next.",0.1

"Game of the year, not even a debate. This game has way, way too much in it. Despite having 10 or so hours in the game. I've barely scratched the surface. The characters, the customization, everything is so in depth it's scary. I haven't been a fan of these types of games until I played this one. Hope this helps",0.1
"It has been years since I have been as thoroughly obsessed with a game as I am with Baldur’s Gate 3. The story and progression are deep, and the ripples from your choices and interactions insure replay ability, as every choice can change the way your play through unfolds. I only wish the level cap was a bit higher.",0.09
"Put simply, Baldur's Gate 3 is the best and most well-rounded RPG I have ever played.  It has incredible combat, incredible quests, incredible reactivity, outstanding characters, great writing, a good story, I could go on.  This game is so strong that anyone who appreciates RPGs must play this.  Video games by their very nature are not capable of fully recreating a TTRPG experience, it's a fundamental limitation born out of the lack of a Dungeon Master.  That said, Baldur's Gate 3 is such a dynamic and reactive game that it is the closest any game has gotten to emulating a TTRPG.",0.1

"Baldur's Gate 3 is an ambitious endeavor that dazzles with its detailed world and deep narrative, true to its Dungeons &amp; Dragons roots. While the game excels in storytelling and stunning graphics, it's marred by occasional bugs and a steep learning curve, particularly in its strategic, turn-based combat. These issues, coupled with pacing inconsistencies, hold it back from being a masterpiece. Nonetheless, for fans of the genre willing to navigate its complexities and overlook its flaws, Baldur's Gate 3 offers a rich and rewarding RPG experience, making it deserving of a solid 7 or 8 out of 10",0.07

"Diving into Baldur's Gate 3, I was seriously pumped for a wild gaming adventure, but man, the excitement quickly fizzled out. The story feels like it's moving at a grandma's pace – slow and steady, but honestly, more like a snail's crawl. I'm all for a good build-up, but this was like waiting for water to boil. Trying to get into the game was a real struggle; the characters and plot took forever to get interesting. And it's not just the story – everything, from exploring to leveling up, felt like wading through molasses. Sure, the game has potential with cool graphics and mechanics, but the slow storytelling just ruins the whole vibe. I want to be on the edge of my seat, not yawning through cutscenes. Until they fix this pacing nightmare, Baldur's Gate 3 is just a frustrating tease of what could have been an epic gaming experience.",0.05

"This is the best game I've played perhaps ever. The story is huge, the in-game choices are all wildly different and take the story to weird and wonderful places. The combat system is fantastic, the graphics are great and the voice acting is as good as Red Dead Redemption 2. I just finished my first playthrough and I'm kinda sad it's over. I also really appreciate the game being released with no issues and no microtra sations or DLC, season passes etc. All in all, this is a must play.",0.1

"Giving this a 5 because I’m only able to play half of the game due to Larian updating the game with a patch that completely broke Act 3. The lag is insane taking 30sec to a minute for NPC and party members to respond (this is offline, mind you), then you move your character a bit and it happens again, and again, and again. Crossing the lower city is a half hour exercise in pure frustration. Some encounters actually cause the game to crash altogether, and that’s not a one-off. I’ve had the same encounter crash the game on my PS5 4 times. I tried deleting and reinstalling the game - no change. The first half of the game was great fun and I’ve played it through twice, but then running into game-breaking performance issues upon arriving in Baldur’s Gate has ruined my initial impression of the game. To add insult to injury, more than 2 weeks after that game-breaking patch Larian has yet to comment on it in the media, their own forums, or anywhere else despite a large player outcry. So now I’ve spent money on a game the developer’s actions have prevented me from completing and that same developer has nothing to say. I’ll think twice before buying any title from Larian in the future.",0.05
This game is amazing. You can play it over and over again in different ways. If you are a fan of D&amp;D you gotta check it out.,0.1
"This... This is... I don't even know what to say. I am in absolute awe that this game even exists. This is the pinnacle of CRPGs and dare I say the pinnacle of gaming. Larian Studios have proved themselves as one of the greatest game development studios of all time, and this is BY FAR the best game I have ever played. Period. The characters, the graphics, the replay value, the music, the combat and above everything else THE STORY are perfect. I genuinly cannot find a single flaw in this game. If you haven't bought the game yet, do yourself a favor and buy it. If you own it already, do yourself a favor and play it again.Congratulations and THANK YOU to Larian Studios for all that they've achieved and given us. And hopefully I'll see you when bg4 releases.TLDR: game is good",0.1

"I'm a true RPG fan, played a lot of them in my old days. And I can say that BG3 is a good game, but not as good as I imagined it. The building system is imbalanced, a random system devalues all your skill leveling, a lot of inconsistencies in the plot, lack of reactivities. I love Larian's other games but I was a bit disappointed with this one",0.07
"It's a very unique game, it’s really not for everybody. More like 50% talking and 50% playing. Too linear and sandboxed. I'm aware that the long rest is part of having a strategy but it's atrociously annoying &amp; tiresome",0.09

"Единственная в своем роде, духовный наследник dragon age: origin, новое слово в жанре српг, и просто смешная и веселая. Не 10, потому что мне не хватило драмы сюжету и большему раскрытию антагонистов, (и финала), а также оптимизация 3 акта на релизе была корявой. Но все равно моя готи.",0.09
"that to me is just a straight 10. The game is so damn good in all aspects: gameplay, story, characters, freedom of doing whatever you are pleased to do in any given situation (based also on the class you are playing). There is so much content and each an every side quest has an impact, a meaning and many outcome and consequeces. I am glad that they took their time to work on this game, refining it, polishing it. I think that at this point BG3 is considered the pinnacle of modern gaming and RPGs in general. They took obviously some libertiesfrom 5e rule book here and there but I think those exceptions are very well blend in the core mechanics of the game. I wish there was a Game master mode in this game like in OS 2. Heck, if the make it, I am also willing to pay it! My only regret is that I bought at 40 € back in early alpha and not at the actual full price as they DESERVE every single cent!",0.1

"As 'bout a perfect representation a person can get of not only a D&amp;D video game, but an RPG in general. Following the formulas and tropes of Dungeons &amp; Dragons as a table-top role-playing game, everything is decided by chance and dice, with modifiers determining consistency. As most people are, I am an avid enjoyer of D&amp;D on the table-top, so its turn-based combat and many things revolving around its core gameplay mechanics came naturally to me and felt natural and intuitive. As for the story and characters, it is what you make of it. Everyone's story will be different based on the choices they make, and the characters the prioritize. For me, I find all of the characters well-rounded and believable, more-so than I believe any game out of a few exceptions have ever been able to achieve... Even characters I wasn't personally drawn to have an intrinsic charm that I can still recognize and say ""yes, someone out there will like that"". The game is as deep as a I believe a game can be, its difficulty is fair but manageable and fluid, its cast are all-timers and the characters they represent are instant classics. If all games were this good, this polished, and this entertaining - I would pre-order every AAA release in a heartbeat.",0.1
"I haven’t been so immersed in an RPG in years. At a time when we’re saturated with empty OWRPG’s, BG3 (not ow) feels immersive and alive.

Gameplay is great allowing creative planning and ways to deal with scenarios. There are some bug issues in the 3rd act that made my game crash at times. Some details don't become rendered in during the 3rd act just due to the shear amount of things on the map.

Only pet peeve i have with it is that the third final act felt to me like it had a lot of cut content and it didnt feel as good and complete as forst two chapters. But i hope they will fiz it in the future,0.1

"After end my first run, I can only say that this is a masterpiece, I can't tell all the thing that was really awsome in just this post, the narrative, the character growth, and the fighting. Personally I didn't like too much the turn-based combat, but in this game they made me adapt and love that combat mode a lot since they also make it very good and fun. In addition to saying that your character really feels like yours, you really have many options of what to do and your decisions will really affect the story in the short and long term. The missions are magnificent because in addition to the fact that they don't seem like missions, they make you interested in them and really feel part of it, making you take secondary missions that don't seem secondary, keeping you entertained in other things without realizing it. The only thing I can say is that if anyone is thinking about playing it and there is anything stopping you from doing it, just try it, you won't regret it, I guarantee it.",0.1

In the second you knew if you played it right you could use the encounters to gather items and experience to increase your power.

"Only had the game for a couple of weeks and over 100hrs in. When my bro suggested it, I was like “meh..role-play.. not my thing”. But then I thought, “Well, I used to play Tunnels and Trolls and D&amp;D when it first came out, so I wonder what it’s like on ps5” So, so glad I did. The mix of turn based and group movement make the game move along smoothly. I find the coma at fun and challenging. I normally steer away from magic as I’m a hack’n’slash kinda guy, but here it’s necessary and enjoyable to use. However,, what makes this game stand out for me are the depth of the character choices and the way that decisions really do have significant repercussions in the game going forward. Character and group decisions mean you have to approach combat scenarios based on your party skills, allowing for multiple playthroughs (however, I’m still in Act 2 after 110hrs). But the main thing is the writing and scenario design. Some encounters are beautifully designed with stunning graphics; some are really challenging; and some are really funny. The behind-the-scenes dice rolling is seamless meaning some traps reallydo take you by surprise. The characters have real depth; so that some that I didn’t warm to at the start are now my favourites (take care though, my bro was a bit careless in his early interactions and two of his party upped sticks and left for good!). I would definitely say this is the most pleasantly surprised I have ever been about a game..ever (well, that I remember.. Silent Hill 1 was a long time ago!). Add to that the continued support and updates from the devs and this, for me, is the one absolutely must have game on next-gen. It has something for everyone. I haven’t tried multiplayer yet, as I like to do first play through alone; so still got that to look forward to. A masterpiece imo; and a bargain at the price.",0.1

Your choices really matter in this game, it’s not like persona 5 that you just say ‘Yes let’s do this’ or ‘im not sure about it’ those types of game dont care about your choices, in this game, you regret your actions or you love them, there are like 20 possible outcomes in every situation, it is AMAZING!!!

"Baldur's Gate 3 is the most polarizing game I have ever played. Never has an RPG been this immersive since The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and the sheer amount of quests, characters and choices you can make is ludicrous. You have complete freedom in how you want to approach quests and when you want to approach them. You rarely have to follow markers, and can get pretty much anywhere in multiple ways. There are too many builds to count, too many areas to explore, too many NPCs to talk too, it almost feels unreal. The world is beautiful, the objects and environments are detailed and the story keeps you interested throughout. Your party members are very well written and come with their own captivating personal stories. They react to the world around you through quests you complete, engage in late night conversations and are generally a treat to interact with bar a few. Every act ramps up in narrative and world building, and Act 3 presents the most captivating plot in the game with great villains and even better sidequests. But, for all the effort that was spent in making the game so ambitious, it feels like none was made to make the game function properly. This is probably the most buggy/glitchy game I have ever played, and I played Cyberpunk 2077. Quests will not start or end properly due to scripting bugs or NPCs being at the wrong place, your party members will get stuck on terrain or refuse to jump after you, lens flares and texture sometime spazz out or arrive late to the party, getting in a room with a big door is a nightmare and the camera can be wonky in some fights. But in the face of the following bugs, these are minor issues: as you approach Act 3, the game starts breaking down, big time. Textures will sometime just not load, the game will start lagging unbearably, meaning you will take 15 seconds to pick up an item or talk to an NPC. My character was suddenly unable to drop items at some point, and some NPCs just start disappearing from important quests. These are not minor issues: they actively harm the game's pacing and kill your motivation to play. Larian needs to get their **** together and fix these numerous bugs. The dice roll mechanics, while an essential part of the D&amp;D experience, can become really annoying, especially early on in fights. You will be facing enemies at your level or higher in Act 1, and since your characters are very weak early on, you will have low chances of hitting anything, which can result in fights being miss contests until someone finally hits someone else and loses half their hp bar. It is bad game design to have such a rough early game and a considerably easier mid/late game. Larian should rework the percentage system and give players an easier time early on, especially when they haven't fully grasped D&amp;D combat mechanics. With that being said, the ambition is clearly here and realized very well, and like Fallout: New Vegas, I am willing to overlook the numerous bugs, making this a top 10 game of all time.",0.09

"Despite not being familiar with Baldur's Gate before the release of the third installment and having known Larian Studios primarily for their Divinity games, I must say that I didn't expect Baldur's Gate 3 to become one of the best games my fiancée and I have ever played. The story is incredibly diverse, original, and unpredictable, making it impossible to anticipate the consequences of one's actions. Alongside the highly interesting characters, there isn't a single NPC who lacks some form of ****'s important to be aware that every action can influence future events, and in the midst of all the back-and-forth, one can sometimes make decisions that impact the game in ways they didn't intend.Moreover, Baldur's Gate 3 is a game that has provided my fiancée and me with a shared escape from the outside world. Despite the limited time due to work constraints, we've spent over 100 hours on our first playthrough. It's not everyone's cup of tea due to its turn-based gameplay mechanics, but I recommend that everyone give it a try to see if it resonates with **** me, it's already a strong contender for the game of the year.",0.1

HOWEVER as of now while the first two acts ran virtually flawless for me on ps5 the third act is another story. It's definitely better after the update but there are still plenty of issues. The final fight was pretty laggy and rough for me as well and characters literally appearing upsidedown during dialogue. I will admit that did leave a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth as it completely rips you out of this immersive adventure you've put so much time and effort into, especially egregious being at such a pivotal time in the game. Even with the negatives though this game is nothing short of incredible. An absolute 9 and would be a masterpiece ten if they can continue patches fix the third act to match the first two.",0.09

And the ability to choose the path of development and skills gives the player freedom in **** combat system is quite complex, but this only adds interest to the game.

They create a unique atmosphere and help to immerse yourself in the world of the **** only negative that I noticed is a small number of bugs and technical problems.

Naturally I feared a numbered entry to my favorite and childhood/young life defining game would tarnish it's legacy, but I am so glad Larian stepped up and put out a product that not only honored the best RPG franchise of all time, but really brought a 3D modeled experience to Faerûn and the Sword Coast, in such a way that the Infinity Engine could never do. You could never capture a crypt or a dungeon and its isolation and desolation as much as a 3D modeled game can (roofs, man), specially with camera unlocking mods.

As a 33y/o w/ a full time job, I've got over 140hrs in on my first play through and I still spend most of my workdays looking forward to getting home &amp; hopping on.

"Gaming for 35 years and this game is in the top 10 for giving me pure joy, tears, and laughter. I feel like a kid again. This game allows the player to find any way they can to deal with a situation/battle/route. In my opinion, this game is the ultimate game in all ways. Graphics, gameplay, and options.

This is my first review **** on metacritic. I was motivated enough to actually do a review because of how amazing this game is. I have played part way through the game and I am aware of the issues with act 3 but even act 1 is enough to have me give this review. I also want to reward a company that's not greedy with dlc and micro transactions. Thank you Larian Studios for such a fun experience.,0.1
Love this game. First game in a while that I was excited for before it released and wasn't let down once it dropped. Already spent nearly 100 hours in game and not even close to done playing. Larian did not disappoint.,0.1
I've barely got into the 3rd act but I am having a blast with this game. I'm playing three different campaigns with my friends and each one is unique. I really wish more RPGs had this level of detail.,0.1

"This is by far my favorite game. The fighting mechanics are fun and less stressful to me than real time fights, the design of the characters, setting, and other details are so good, the story is unique and enjoyable, and the dating mechanics are really fun! There’s so many things you can do, so many places you can go, and so many different ways you can play this game. If you’re ok with playing a mature game, this one is an amazing choice.

This game is exceptional . I am at loss of words. This game has set the bar so high i cannot enjoy games anymore other than this. Yet many people have the audacity to compare this and even say Starfield is better . like this delusional person omonoslogikos wrote a review and gave 4 stars out of 10 and gave starfield 7 where in starfield you cannot even explore in the right sense. BG 3 is so unique i cant even fathom words you just have to experience it . Im 26 years old and the last game that caught me like this was Oblivion back in 2006 this gave me such a power brought back my childhood i played this a month in a row .

"Baldur's Gate is actually great. It is not the best-optimised game out there and may potentially suffer from freezing on older systems. Between its release and the early access of release of Starfield, I put in about 300 hours into this game. It was not enough. There is so much that I still want to go back and do. And even with the sheer size of the game, very little about its content will leave you wanting. Sure, some stories are not as interesting as others. Karlach and Astarion's companion quests are far better written than Wyll and the other companions' quests. However, you may not even realise this due to the stellar performance that the cast put in. The game's graphics are excellent and shine through cutscenes with expressive characters that will captivate and have you invested in their stories for days. I am on the fence regarding the battles but that is not enough to take away from this game. Baldur's Gate 3 being developed by Larian Studios was inevitably expected to live up to the highs of the studios' previous Divinity title. Boy, did it knock it out of the park!",0.1

Je me suis dis, je retente cette expérience avec BG3, tant pis le jeu avait l'air bien et j'en attendais rien perso, j'avais aimé Divinity 2 mais les mécaniques (armure magie, armure physique) ça m'a gavé, quand j'ai vu qu'il n'y avait pas ça, déjà ça partait bienEt bien après avoir fini BG3, j'ai pas regretté mon achat, et je pense que c'est le seul jeu qui a su lavé ma frustration (MERCI) car j'ai senti que le jeu a été fait avec passion, avec attachement aux persos, que chaque détail est **** suis donc reparti sur une second run, peut être même une troisième, je ne sais pas encore mais je veux continuer ce jeu, il n' y a pas de fin pour moi",0.1

This has Elden Ring, but this game is awesome in the liberty and how you face each challenge. Every moment makes you think how you will appproach. And I'm sure I will not find all the secrets but each time I play I know that something interesting will happen and I will discover something. You just don't want to stop playing.

"Wow, just wow. This was my first time ever playing a turn-based RPG and I didn’t know anything about D&amp;D going into this. I usually play games like GTA, FIFA and shooters, so I did not expect to like or understand this game. I was wrong. The first hours were hard. I did not understand the fighting mechanics and I was close to giving up.  As you can see from this review, I did not.. I decided to play a little bit more, and 2 hours turned into 5 hours, and 5 hours turned into 50 hours, and 50 hours to 100 hours…. This is the best story I have ever experienced in a game. All the choices, mistakes and accomplishments matters and I am able to craft my own story. How is it even possible to make a game where there is a story line for ever possible outcome? I can’t wrap my head around how much time and passion the developers must have put in to this. I played it for so long and did so many quests, but I still feel like I just scratched the surface of the game, and I am ready to play it again and do things differently. I usually never want to play the story from a single-player game more than once, but I feel like I can play this 5 more times and have completely different experiences and outcomes. I still don’t understand half of it, and the game is hard,  but that is just fine. There is so much to learn, so many more stories to experience. I finally understand why so many people like these type of games. 10/10! Btw, remember to backup save all the time! I learned that the hard way…",0.1

"Le jeu est tout simplement incroyable. Je n'avais jamais joué à un jeu imprégné dans cet univers de ""Donjons et Dragons"" mais j'ai juste adoré la proposition de Larian. La direction artistique est magnifique et les zones très jolies à explorer. Pour ceux qui affectionnent les RPG offrant pléthore de choix, ce jeu est fait pour vous. Je me suis surpris à rejouer certaines séquences et c'est juste fou de voir à quel point des décisions pouvant paraître mineures à l'instanté, aboutissent à des conséquences étonnantes et très différentes plus **** dans l'aventure. Que dire à propos de la narration qui est juste à couper le souffle. Tant au niveau des possibilités qu'à celui du doublage des acteurs (notamment Neil Newbon qui joue la voix d'Astarion ou Devora Wilde dans le rôle de Lae'zel). Le gameplay au tour par tour peut surprendre au début c'est vrai mais une fois que l'on comprend la plupart des mécaniques, on ne voit plus le temps s'écouler. Alors oui, ce jeu n'est pas conçu pour séduire tout le monde. Il demande beaucoup d'investissement mais il en vaut largement la peine à mon humble avis. Côté défauts, honnêtement, il n'y a pas grand chose à relever. Néanmoins, il faut s'accrocher les 10 premières heures de jeu car si vous ne connaissez pas du tout les règles de D&amp;D (ce qui était mon cas), vous pourriez vous sentir frustré par certains combats et il est vrai que Larian aurait pu selon moi, un peu plus expliquer certaines situations afin de moins galérer au début mais je pense qu'ils ne voulaient pas donner cette impression de trop ""assister"" les joueurs en les harcelant toutes les 2 minutes d'informations. Passé ce cap, le jeu devient vraiment plaisant et la difficulté normale demeure stimulante. Juste à titre d'informations, vous passerez beaucoup de temps à visiter des lieux et ramasser des objets (environ 50% à vue de nez). L'autre moitié du temps de jeu sera consacré aux combats et aux cinématiques/discussions avec des PNJ je dirais. Raison pour laquelle, je précisais d'entrée que BG3 reste un jeu qui ne plaira pas à toute la communauté mais si vous recherchez une expérience unique, vous devriez tenter le coup. Je lui attribue la note de 10 car même si je n'aime pas trop donner la note maximale, je trouve important de valoriser le travail d'un studio quand il est réellement bien fait. Les Belges de Larian méritent amplement ce succès et je me réjouis des ventes actuelles qui semblent très bonnes encore à l'heure actuelle. À mes yeux, on a clairement le futur GOTY. Et si cela peut permettre de faire se réveiller quelques studios trop prompts à la paresse, et bien tant mieux si BG3, comme d'autres grands jeux, devient un de ces jeux références aujourd'hui. Si Larian parvient à le faire alors je ne vois pas pourquoi Bethesda, Ubisoft, EA, Rockstar Games et tant d'autres ne peuvent plus suivre la cadence alors qu'ils ont infiniment plus de moyens. Ah oui et j'oubliais, les musiques sont très belles comme tout le reste de la bande son. Si vous êtes un fan de RPG, vous devez impérativement y jouer au moins une fois dans votre vie. Au risque de passer à côté d'une expérience incomparable.",0.1

"This game is frankly unbelievable. A lot of people say that Act 3 kind of ruins the experience, but when you look at Act 3 without directly comparing it to Acts 1 and 2, it is still leagues above the best content that most other modern games offer. This really feels like the next Witcher 3; The next generation-defining RPG experience. It's been 8 years since Witcher 3 and I doubt we'll see another game come close to BG3 for ANOTHER 8 years. This may very well maintain its position as Game of the Decade, and that's not even to mention the frequent patches Larian has been releasing as well as the community mod support.",0.1

I'm on my 4th playthrough and I'm still enjoying it and exploring the expanse of choices you have and the impact it has on the world. It's fun to play solo and with friends and does feel like playing D&amp;D. Honestly can't express how much I love this game and the excessively perfect casting for every character. Such a joy to play!",0.1

"At a time when big, rich studios carefully groom reviewers to award them overblown and unwarranted positive acclaim to what are dull and unspirited releases, along comes Larian Studios with a simply perfect RPG that blows the standards for what makes a great game out of the gaming waters. This is the best PC game I've played- possibly ever. While the graphics and music are wonderful, it's the depth and breadth of BG3's content, it's tactical tenacity, and the way Larian breathes life into virtually ALL of it's npcs that inspires a sense of wonder, adventure and life into this magnificent achievement. It stands SO TALL, in my estimation, beside everything else there is to offer out there today.",0.1

"This game is exactly what we imagined the gaming industry would become 30 years ago, and even more so, to be honest. It represents a much-needed breath of fresh air amidst the cursed addiction that studios have to 'games as a service' or the idea of 'buy 500 DLCs.' Not to mention Gacha, which is a pocket-draining trap!Gone are the days when games were complete and satisfying experiences right after purchase. The times when you unboxed your game, and the whole world unfolded before you, without microtransactions or content locked behind paywalls. Baldur's Gate 3 is a response to that nostalgia and a reminder that games can be a work of art in themselves, without the constant exploration of players' **** game is truly impressive, from its technical choices to its creative ones. The quality is undeniable. I'm on my fifth journey through the game, and I still find myself surprised by new discoveries every time I play! It's an experience that never loses its charm.Baldur's Gate 3 offers a rich and complex narrative, memorable characters, and gameplay that challenges and engages the player. It's a breath of fresh air in a world of games that often seem to focus more on sales numbers than providing a genuinely captivating experience.This is the kind of game that reminds us why we fell in love with video games in the first place. A modern masterpiece that honors the roots of the RPG genre and leaves us eagerly anticipating the future of the series. Baldur's Gate 3 is a true treasure in the world of gaming and an example of what the industry could be if it prioritized quality over greed.",0.1

"Cela faisait fort longtemps que je n'avais pas ressentie un tel engouement pour un jeux vidéos. J'ai un peu plus de 30 ans d'experience en tant que gamer et je dois dire que j'ai eu l'occasion de faire quelques pépites dans ce domaine. Nous sommes en 2023 et Larian a réussi me re- faire découvrir tout ce pourquoi je joue au jeux vidéo. Une aventure exceptionnelle, dans lequel je suis l'acteur principal qui doit prendre sa destiné en main pour évoluer dans un univers épique qui regorge de secret, d'extraordinaire, de sensations, de sentiments et d'implication personnel. Et oui soyons clair, Baldur's Gate 3 demande un énorme investissement, tant par sa complexité de gameplay que par la compréhension de son univers. Une vrais bouffé de fraîcheur dans une époque où le jeux vidéo reste cambré sur bien souvent la facilité qui fait vendre. En tout cas merci encore à Larian de montrer ce que peut être un véritable jeux de rôle vidéoludique !!! Baldur's Gate 3 mérite le GOTY 2023, et il mérite de rejoindre le panthéon des grands jeux sortaient depuis 30 ans ! En tout cas c’est mon GOTY !",0.1

"this is the best rgp I've played. I liked something more in pathfinder wotr, something was cool in divinity, but here it was implemented differently and definitely deserves 10 out of 10. Of course, there are questions about Act 3, there is not enough epic, the city is somehow too big, there are a lot of lags and no tensions within the city.  After act 2 the temperature drops. I want to express my deep respect to the developers.  For the first time in many years, developers are doing things for players and not for money.",0.1

"The best RPG of 2023: Larian Studios has demonstrated how to create a superb game in an era where many big companies primarily focus on profit, often neglecting the quality of their products. They frequently release games with subpar optimization and quality improvements, leaving players wanting more, on the other hand, has shown a commitment to quality and improvement by constructing a captivating narrative that rewards players for exploring diverse paths and objectives, whether they are related to the main plot or the characters in the story. While the game is not without its bugs, as no game is perfect, the developers are dedicated to addressing issues and enhancing gameplay. This dedication places Baldur's Gate 3 among the best games based on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons tabletop RPG franchise.",0.1

"Baldur's Gate 3 offers compelling character development, balanced combat, and abundant dialogue options for diverse endings.

"One of the greatest games I have truly ever played. I do rate it a 10/10 for how it is. However, I truly hope that Larian Studios gives Act 3 the same treatment that they did for DOS2. If there is a total rewrite of the final act with the same quality as their last major title, then I will be genuinly surprised if there will be a greater RPG than BG3 withing the next ten years. Each and every playthough I have done, I have discovered something I missed. This game truly has enraptured me and the sheer effort put forth by Larian Studios to encompass as much of D&amp;D 5e as possible in a video game is something I habe never seen from a AAA studio. Of course the main goal of making games is to sell and make the company money, but I personally feel that this studio has made providing an unforgettable experience to players to be a greater priory than sheer financial gain. The transparency that they have given in thiercommunity updates and acceptance of coding mistakes and bugs far outrivals ANY game company I've seen to date. I expect many more future great updates to BG3 and many more amazing titles to cone from Larian Studios. While there still are crashes and bugs in this game, the same can be said for every game in existence. Therfore, I rate this a 10/10 for how amazing this game is and how amazing the studio has been towards their players. Other companies should take note on how to make a truly incredible game.",0.1

No, its now cemented itself as #1 best game I have ever played. Larian gave so much attention and detail to the world and story that you can tell they really love what they do. They treated the world and characters with such respect that I cant recall seeing in recent memory. Most times if its a revival of a old series - its a cash grab. Not with them. They revived it because they loved it and the Dark Urge redemption is top tier what story telling should be in an RPG. Every character you meet, you end up caring about in some way or form.  I cant get over how much I love this game. I've played it 5 times, each time - I find something new.",0.1

"I love this game. It is easily one of the best gaming experiences that I have had in my two decades of gaming. Particularly, Act 1 and Act 2 were an absolute joy to play through. Unfortunately, Act 3 fails to provide a similar experience to the two previous ones. Immediately upon starting Act 3, I have faced numerous game breaking bugs. The act is plagued by massive FPS drops, dialogue drops, texture loading problems, and broken quests. As much as it pains me to say, this is another game that was released at an unfinished state. Larian created something amazing with this game, but we should not overlook the fact that the game is unfinished. This practice has become far too common among publishers nowadays. They deserve praise for what they have accomplished, but that does not absolve them from deserved criticism for putting out an unfinished game. Due to the length of the game, many critics did not progress enough through the game to experience these major issues before giving it glowing reviews. Hopefully, Larian will fix Act 3 soon.",0.07

However, every character undergoes their own unique development, which is intriguing, accompanied by numerous captivating side quests. The game also offers unparalleled freedom. Players can progress in ways previously unimaginable. This depth in the storyline and the breadth of freedom does wane slightly in Act 3. Rumor has it that this is due to the game being unfinished, which is unfortunate. Nonetheless, this is more than compensated for by the vastness of the Baldur Gate city. Considering I've already invested nearly 120 hours by the end, adding even more content might have been a bit overwhelming. Overall, it's a truly masterful experience.",0.1

While for the story the game offers thousands of lines of dialogue, all different from each other and therefore each run will be different from the previous one. You can literally do whatever you want and the game really rewards lateral thinking. And the lore is nothing short of fantastic. 10/10",0.1

"Masterpiece, everything I've ever wanted in an RPG and more. All the plotlines are interesting and engaging, the main characters all have their own subplots which are tied to the main themes. The level of detail of relatable and appropriate lore/detail throughout the world is insane,Idont think I've ever been as engrossed in a game world as this. I am a lifelong, heavy gamer and I will contend that this is the best game ever made, knocking Larian's previous game; Divinity: Original Sin 2 off of my top spot. The turn-based battles are far more engaging than most action RPG combat and way more strategic and interesting than any RTWP title.

"Baldur's Gate 3 is a masterwork of cinematic storytelling with compelling, deep characters, uniquely crafted tactical encounters and a new secret behind every nook and cranny. But the most fascinating thing is, how many options you as a player have in solving quests or handling conflicts, making every run-through an impressively unique and memorable experience. There is no filler in this game, every sentence feels impactful and important, every quest feels fresh and intriguing, every item you get has it's place in a build you just have to try. Baldur's Gate 3 **** the borders of what we thought to have been possible in RPGs and videogames in general, and this seemingly with ease. I don't think we will see a game like this in many many years, if ever. Just be aware, I don't know a single person that started this game and didn't get lost in it.

"Some pros and cons for those who don't want to read huge elaborate. Starting with pros - game is really enjoyable when you play with your friends mostly because of roleplaying stuff). Character creation is complex and enjoyable. Every single action counts and shapes your world. When it comes to cons - this game is just a buggy mess from the start to end and I'm not even talking about small bugs (graphics glitches etc.) but about gamebreaking ones like need for duing a quick save load (f8) because of boss reward bug. Camera is working very poorly (especially in closed areas like caves). Fights are boring because AI is taking a lot of time to do it's actions and if there is nothing to do it lags a lot (for example monster cannot strike you but he waits 10-15 seconds and skips turn). Pathing of your team members is really bad, especially when they need to jump a lot. I found myself ungroupping them and moving one by one because of indivitualities lagging behind. Political propaganda was injected into the game and I'm not talking about relations between your character and the others, it's about main story...",0.04

"I played Baldur's Gate 3 with a certain degree of skepticism towards turn-based combat, a type of combat I hadn't particularly warmed up to in the past. However, this game managed to make me fall in love with this mechanic. Nevertheless, I must admit that some battles can become excessively lengthy, to the point where I found myself getting up from my chair and doing other things while the enemies took their turns.Baldur's Gate 3 boasts an incredibly engaging storyline with a wide range of choices that influence the course of the narrative. Unfortunately, this narrative flexibility loses some momentum towards the end of the game, but it remains a strong point. The allies and origin characters in the game are all fascinating and distinct, integrating well into the game world. The only aspect that feels less immersive is your own character, who, due to the choice not to voice all the dialogue lines (likely to expedite development), can sometimes make the player feel like an outsider in the game world. However, it's important to note that this is a common issue in games with a customizable protagonist. For this reason, I recommend selecting the Dark Urge origin at the beginning of the game to have a better integration into the plot and the overall **** conclusion. Baldur's Gate 3 has proven to be one of the best RPGs and games in general that I've ever played. With a gripping story, a vast array of choices, captivating characters, and turn-based combat that pleasantly surprised me, it's a remarkable gaming experience. I can confidently say it's the best game I've played this year.",0.09
"This game is a must play for any fantasy lovers, who enjoy a good story with captivating characters. I’ve spent more than 200 hours playing this game and I simply want to keep playing - the replayability is insane. Your choices make a real difference - what would happen if you went evil instead of good? What would happened if you got involved with the mage instead of the vampire? So many possibilities and if you are someone who enjoys games, you’ll definitely enjoy Baldur’s Gate 3.",0.1

"I enjoying this game so much and I was not used to turn based combat in RPGs, yet I get used to it almost instantly. Love the excellent quest, superb writing, extraordinary characters... every companion is different with their goals, morals, quests, characteristics... last time when I felt something like that was in Witcher 3 and that is few years ago. I must recommend this game to anyone who have no problem with turn based combat, have enough time and enjoyed Dragon Age: Origins, Witcher 3 or Mass Effect Trilogy. This game can take so much time... but where else You can scratch dog and owlbear in same time ? Anyway, if You missing a feel when playing RPG with good story, great quests, interesting world, amazing characters, then this is a ""must have"" game for You. If You prefer fast paced real time combat, then this isn't for You, yet I can speak for myself, that it is easy to get used to it, so You may give it a try.",0.09
"It's one of my favorite games of the year. The amount of choices you can make yourself to change the outcome of almost any battle is excellent. There isn't exactly one style of play, as you can experiment with all classes and races, with whatever cantrip or spells, etc. The music hits the feeling of the game, and the comedy in some parts is hilarious, and sometimes it does have its most serious moments, too. The multiplayer is also fun with main friends, but there are great times to have with even randoms, with everyone having their unique build or just doing individual actions with their character.",0.1

"The perfect game does not exist but baldur's gate 3 really comes close, a true RPG where the story BASED ON YOUR CHOICES has a REAL impact in the game world. I've finished the game 5 times (I'm starting the 6 run.....) and EVERY time something new happens and/or I find something new or events I already know that have totally new consequences opening up new quests/dialogues or new movies to me simply SUBLIME! Companions are perfectly characterized with a background, feelings, reactions to you and react to how you treat them (in one run shadowheart came to my camp to kill me!!!) simply wonderful. Very nice graphics and animations the close-ups in the face in your companions really convey the feelings they have NEVER seen anything better in a video game. Flaws: I hate the inventory menu and find its options a bit cumbersome but nothing that bad. SOUND: The music is perfect in all situations. Ladies and gentlemen this is not the game of the year but the GAME OF THE DECADE!!! Immense, deep, strategic a game where FINALLY you don't have to hit random keys but reason about the dialogues, in the fights and a boundless lore it feels like you are really in the forgotten realms.

This game is complex in the level of options of how to handle the situations you can find yourself in.

"Zaczynają swoją przygodę z Wrotami Baldura czułem, że moja recenzja jest już praktycznie gotowa, lecz po pewnym czasie moje odczucia były troszkę zmieszane. Swoją recenzje chciałbym rozpocząć od plusów, bo takowych nie brakuje. To co mi się ogromnie podobało w grze to postacie, które możemy w zależności od naszych preferencji przyjąć jako naszych towarzyszy bądź nie. To my mamy wpływ na to w jaki sposób chcemy zbudować swój zespół. Mimo wszystko każda z nich posiada unikalną historię, która przeplata się wraz z naszą w trakcie przechodzenia gry. immersyjnym elementem jest tutaj również tworzenie relacji pomiędzy naszymi bohaterami, dając nam częsty odpoczynek od wątku głównego. Kolejnym plusem jest różnorodność światów. Lokacje jak i osoby/stworzenia jakie przyjdzie nam spotkać starannie oddają klimat miejscu w jakim się znajdujemy. Nie ma tutaj mowy o powtarzalności albo odczuciu, że już odwiedziliśmy dany obszar. Ten świat aż się chce eksplorować, ponieważ w każdym zakamarku czeka na nas nowa przygoda (czasami dosłownie)  W dodatku świetnie została skonstruowana tutaj mechanika rozwiązywania zagadek obszarowych, które pobudzają myślenie i naszą ciekawość, nigdy nie wiadomo czy za jakąś szafą nie czeka przejście do nowej podziemnej lokacji w której jacyś ludzie nie mają problemu do rozwiązania. Kolejnym plusem (który trochę mnie przerósł) jest rozwój naszych bohaterów. Ilość czarów, umiejętności pasywnych, zaklęć, atutów, akcji a obok tego jeszcze broni jest tutaj zaskakująco duża, przez co można spędzić przy tym sporo czasu. Ostatnim najważniejszym plusem są moim zdaniem dialogi, których również w grze nie brakuje. Niemalże każda postać ma nam coś do powiedzenia, mniej lub bardziej ciekawego. Bardzo podoba mi się system rzucania kością, co sprawia, że nasze konwersacje są ciekawsze, ponieważ rozmowa nie jest w 100 procentach ustalona przez nas, a przez wynik, którym możemy manipulować, w zależności od umiejętności rozmowy naszych bohaterów. Efektem takiego działania jest również pokazanie graczom, że złe rzuty wcale nie muszą oznaczać złego rezultatu, a mogą przedstawić nam inną ciekawą kontynuacje. Najwyższy czas przejść do minusów. Chciałbym aby te minusy były traktowane z dystansem, ponieważ są one mocno subiektywne i nie muszą wcale oznaczać złego przygotowania ze strony twórców, chociaż ja mam osobiście odmienne zdanie. Po 50 godzinach gry, gdy kończyłem pierwszy akt grało mi się cudownie, raz sobie z kimś pogadałem, raz z kimś powalczyłem, lecz od drugiego aktu zaczęły się problemy. Pojedynki z wrogami często wyglądały tak, że przeciwnicy mający dwa a nawet trzy poziomy mniej ode mnie mielili mnie nieustannie. Miałem wówczas ustawiony poziom trudności Łatwy, ponieważ w drugim akcie na Średnim już się nie dało. Często jednak te pojedynki wygrywałem, ledwo uchodząc z życiem, podnosząc kompanów którzy leżeli na ziemi. Starałem się każdą postać zbudować jak najlepiej się da, zachowując przy tym kontrast obrażeń, kupowałem najlepsze sety jakie się dało, lecz było ciężko w każdej potyczce, ale jakoś się doczołgałem do trzeciego aktu, który dobił mnie już totalnie. Historia toczy się dalej, ale walk trzy razy więcej, co 10 metrów jakaś kolejna walka. Przeciwnicy słabsi poziomem robili ze mną co chcieli. Najbardziej uciążliwy był moment, kiedy moja postać była albo czymś ''zablokowana'' albo chybiła atak, po czym nadchodziła tura przeciwnika... przeciwników, ponieważ była ich cała horda jednocześnie. Ilość pojawiających się kreatur w górnym panelu przyprawiała mnie o dreszcze. W ten sposób, kiedy moje postacie już chybiły wszystkie ataki nadeszła kolej, w której wszyscy przeciwnicy wyprowadzali swoje ciosy. Tyle tego było, że zdążyłbym pójść do kuchni zrobić sobie jedzenie i wrócić mając swoją turę, o ile moje postacie do tego czasu jeszcze stały na nogach. Poczułem wielką ulgę kiedy historia dobrnęła do końca i mogłem zobaczyć zakończenie, ponieważ ostatni pojedynek musiałem resetować kilkanaście razy. Podsumowując. Całość mimo wszystko oceniam bardzo dobrze. Zawsze staram się patrzeć na gry z różnych perspektyw i z ogromną wyrozumiałością, dlatego myślę, że te minusy dla innych mogą nie istnieć, albo nawet być plusami. Mi jednak pozostało cieszyć się historią, bo była ona bajeczna i długo jej nie zapomnę. Serdecznie polecam tę grę wszystkim miłośnikom turowych RPGów, ponieważ bardzo rzadko wychodzą tak dobre produkcje. Larian Studio pokazało, że można stworzyć grę, która nie wymaga większych poprawek po premierze, a co gorsza zachęcania do gry tanim sposobem mikropłatności.",0.08

"it is better then DoS2 when it comes down to scale and cinematics, however playing conjurer/necromancer is damn boring, since they nerfed Necromancy of Thai. You still likely to enjoy the game if your favorite class is warrior/barbarian/rogue, not so much with orhers",0.1

"Baldur's Gate 3 is a masterpiece ****. The graphics are stunning, the world is detailed, and the characters are well-written. The story is engaging and keeps you hooked from beginning to end. The combat system is incredibly deep and complex, and the game's world interacts with you in interesting and unique ways. The puzzles feel truly unique, and the exploration of the world is a rewarding experience. The game is full of digital delights such as weapons and items, interactive stories and characters, mini-games, crafting, and so much more. I've had countless hours of entertainment and I love the fact that the game is upgradeable with new content. Baldur's Gate 3 is a fantastic RPG and I highly recommend it to any fan of the genre.",0.1
I bought the game in early access und never touched it until the full release. For me the absolut best game I ever played. Thx Larian.,0.1
Tiene que ser increíble poder jugar a este juegazo. Solo me llegaba para una Series S y no por ello voy a criticar la grandiosidad de este juegazo. Aburrido de las pantallas de carga al atravesar cada puerta y de las cinemáticas entre cambios de planeta de Starfield.,0.1

"I've had early access on my old janky PC for ages, and I genuinely loved the world, the combat, the characters. Given how much I already knew I would enjoy the game, I honestly didn't expect my PS5 experience to surprise me with how much I'm enjoying it! The story has me hooked, and I know I've barely scratched the surface, there seems to be multiple paths to completing all objectives, huge story based or small side objectives. I find myself caring more about my companions than most games with a similar crew or gang where I tend to only want to bother with a few. But either through humor or interesting backstory I find myself wanting to engage with my companions more. In short, I love it.",0.1
"this is the game I dreamed about. the only minus for me is that fight are a bit too easy. but quests, adventure, spirit of DND it's all here. I'll say - when the game ended i was crying, i never had such emotions.",0.1

"I’m still on act one and can’t put this game down! The world is beautiful, and I can’t help exploring every inch of it! The characters are very well written and all feel real and worth investing time into. The combat is fun and engaging. I find myself really enjoying the turn based combat. I’ve never really enjoyed it but with this game I’ve gone into it with an open mind and it’s actually a lot of fun working out what I can do and how I can take out the enemies. This game is a breath of fresh air and it’s nice to play a game at launch that is completely finished and not a broken buggy mess. Yes there are some issues with frame rates but nothing game breaking. And I’m very happy with the idea that this game has no microtransactions no payed dlc it’s a one time payment and you have hundreds of hours of content. The studio really should be proud of themselves for putting a lot of love and care into a game, one that is easily my contender for game of the year! This is a perfect game for sure",0.1
"Very good game, it's among the best games I've ever played. It's the first game of this style that I've played. The story is very good and well told. Acts 1 and 2 are perfect, act 3 would need to be better worked on (both in the technical part and in the story part), but nothing that ruins the game experience.",0.1
"Was a huge fan of Larian’s past work, and in awe of the level of detail, complexity and possibility in Divinity: Original Sin 2, and didn’t think any modern RPG could surpass those aspects; but damnit, they’ve done it again. And not only that, the level of depth and player agency is somehow even greater. The dedication to replicating the tabletop experience, uncompromising commitment to respecting the player’s intelligence, and the unfathomable, passionate attention to detail is unmatched by its peers. The perfect RPG adventure: tactical, deep, intelligent combat paired with unrivaled player choice and endless possibilities. What more could you ask for out of an RPG? Larian are the modern torchbearers of the role-playing game.",0.1
"The game is one of the best games I have ever played. The story, characters, and world is very immersive. It is turn based crpg so that may detract from your enjoyment if you do not like those sorts of games. It is one of those once every 10 years sort of games that push the envelope of what is possible in gaming well done! Oh and best of all no micro transactions and amazing dev. team that cares.",0.1
"Amazing game! ALL negative reviews are disgusting Starfield and Zelda fanboys who don't even own BG3, trying their hardest to review-bomb the clear GOTY, so their games can stand a chance. Ignore them, they are toxic sore losers.",0.1
"It's decent enough. I'm not a huge fan of the dice rolling aspect, but the story and characters easily make up for that.",0.08

"Baldur's Gate 3 is not a perfect game, but it is an inspired masterpiece and love letter to lovers of the RPG genre and D&amp;D in particular.  It has some of the most interesting writing i've ever seen in a video game and the voice acting is among the best I've ever seen in a video game.  I've already recommended this game to anyone who will listen.",0.1
"Normally I play first person action or third person action games that don't have a steep learning curve or or require significant time investment to get some kind of enjoyment or value out of. This is the first RPG since Mass Effect trilogy that actually has me hooked. Like any good RPG, your engagement with the world, committing to making choices and experimentation is actually rewarded, meaningful and beautifully executed across gameplay systems and story telling. Every once in a while any medium whether it be gaming, movies books or comics, a true masterpieces comes to set new standards. Highly recommend it anyone looking to get lost in an immersive story driven experience. Imagine not growing doing hardcore nerd stuff like magic the gathering or DnD and now being curious as an adult, that's how good it is.",0.1
"Superbe RPG parfaitement realisé, sans bug avec un graphisme a la hauteur et des dialogues de haut vol. Digne successeur des Baldur's Gate précédent.

But when you continue in the story you realize that in making decisions and actions to do you have all the freedom that a game can offer you. This game has a lot of endings, that makes it hundreds of hours of entertainment. You can also **** with a bear the best rpg I have ever played and I think the best rpg of this generation.

The depth of choices and consequences makes every decision feel impactful, ensuring a highly personalized gaming experience. What truly sets Baldur's Gate 3 apart is its engaging party dynamics, where each character feels distinct and integral to the narrative. While Starfield has its merits, Baldur's Gate 3's intricate storytelling and character-driven gameplay provide a level of immersion and emotional investment that's hard to match.

As someone who has not played a DND game before and only had limited exposure to turn-based combat RPGs, I was pleasantly surprised.

Anyone who has actually gotten past Act 1 (approx. 36% of people) would know that Act 2 and 3 has some pretty bad bugs and balancing issues. A great game but its clear that it still needs some balancing patches. Act 1 is perfect (but thats after years of user feedback) but its clear that Act 2 and 3 should have been put in early access before full release.,0.08
There's nothing that I wouldn't love in this game ,0.1
This is without a doubt the best RPG I have ever played. Just wow. Everything about it is just perfect. The story is really thrilling and grasps you. Every companion is super well written and has something interesting to them. Also the lack of bugs and the complete non existence of micro transactions makes this a unicorn in the current game market. This might just be my favorite game of all time.,0.1

Now it seems larian has beaten me to it and delivered a masterpiece of design. Never have I ever had so many choices, so much freedom, so much potential. Throughout my first and second playthrough much of my time was spent thinking about things to do next time -theres that much to do !. You can test your combat skills, slay your foes, discover secrets, cry, or fall in love (either with a character that puts real people to shame or with the baeuty of Faerun). This is a must play just like elden ring or minecraft or read dead redemtion. Even if it's not your genre, this demands your attention.",0.1

"Larian managed to build an absolutely amazing world.

"how is this possible to make such good and detailed game? i hated turn based games cause i thought they were boring, but this masterpiece totally changed my mind",0.1
"The lack of micro transactions and relative polish justify the game's price tag. I disagree with negative reviews that this game is too expensive for what it is. Larian are to be lauded for sticking to pro-consumer methods. That being said, the content of the game is bad. The voice acting at times sounds sound-boothy, and it isn't helped by the insufferable dialog and character writing. The combat is tedious and boring. I get a lot of people like this game, and find it liberating. I found it surprisingly limiting for creative choices after hearing about the vast freedom. The clips I see of people going ""omg that worked"" all seem fairly obvious to me. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't. I don't think it's a good game, but I respect Larian.",0.04
"Ok, this is without a doubt those kind of game you get once every 10-20 years. Thank you Larian. Divinity was amazing too but this is just same with the quality of fully (and amazingly done) VA which makes the difference a lot. The scope and imersion is huge. Hats down and respect!",0.1

I really hope that Larian fixes this and gives us everything that was cut, to have a complete experience as promised.",0.09

There is only one thing, that is to be criticised, and that is the worsening performance and technical issues, as i progressed through the game. There wasnt anything gamebreaking, but something has to be done about it (and currently it is, as it seems). Overall i think, i can fairly say, that this is game of the year.",0.09

It’s Baldur’s Gate… that is all you need to know about this. Baldur’s Gate 2 Dark Alliance was the first game I played to get into the series with my brother and cousins growing up during summer vacation. Since then I’ve played them all and this was one of the games I was HIGHLY ANTICIPATING this year as it seemed like the clear winner for GOTY and how beautiful the game looked. Honestly pick this game up on pc vs console though the PS5 version is looking great too!!!,0.1
The best game I ever played. At some points a little bit buggy and slow. But this is to be expected by such a huge game. You can play many times and after I finished the game the first time I rushed to make a new character. I just can't stop playing in the best way possible!,0.1

The game's immersive world and captivating storyline seamlessly draw players into a rich fantasy realm, where every decision carries weight. The depth of character customization allows players to truly embody their chosen fighter roles, from tactical strategists to fearless warriors. Baldur's Gate 3's attention to detail in both gameplay and storytelling is a testament to its excellence in the RPG genre. Whether you're a seasoned adventurer or new to the realm, this game promises hours of joy and a sense of achievement.""",0.05
"Best CRPG created so far. I've played a lot, and the storytelling, combat, lore, companions, every detail is far away from other tittles, even DOS:2. They brought to the genre a timless masterpice which introduce so many players to the genre. Overall Act 1 is a 10/10, Act 2 10/10 Act 3 8.5/10 (They'll polish the last act with patches). A lot of people is reviewbombing the game cause the GOTY **** it seems some Nintento fans wants Zelda TOTK to win it. But this game deserves a solid 9.5. Enjoy the journey, don't rush it, this isn't a game with quest, this is an adventure.",0.1

Baldurs Gate made me feel like I felt when I would stay up all night with my game boy color, desperate to advance the story a little further. The characters, combat, worldbuilding, and magic are fantastic. Couldn’t recommend any higher, even as someone who has never heard of Larian or played any of their games before. It’s a little less polished and buggy as you progress, but still a 10/10 in its current state.",0.1

"The game follows 5e dungeons and dragons and is set in the Forgotten realms. The writing does a great job tying in Forgotten Realms lore and weaving in interesting stories with all of the potential companions. I appreciate how much choice you have in developing their stories as you progress. In terms of the main plot I think they did a good job from start to finish making it a memorable campaign. You can do a lot to alter how the game ultimately ends even if there is a path laid out before you, much like playing through one of the many d&amp;d book adventures. Mechanically there are differences between this game and the tabletop game but mostly in the form of removing small nuanced rules to make it a bit more accessible for a wider audience. However this means some builds can be pretty wild, because those restrictions exist in the tabletop game for balance reasons. But even so the scale of the game and the enemies, especially on tactician, make it a worthwhile ride whether you're hyper optimized or not. I'll be playing this for many years to come.",0.1

The replayability is so good each playthrough always show something new that you miss or didn't notice from the first playthrough. The freedom you have to play how you want to play. The story telling is really good and complete, voice acting and facial expressions of the characters are amazing.",0.1

"This is 100% GOTY material. the scale of this game is MASSIVE, the story for EVERY SINGLE QUEST is unique, the characters are interesting (except for wyll, idk buddy, you are BORING). While there are some performance issue on an older gpu (i use RX 570 4gb) like the vulkan not working at all and sometimes when it does work, the game will freezes to the point you need to restart pc.

"I've always loved the RPG genre, where the best games create a world that you can immerse yourself in, and characters that you can grow to love, all while giving you the choice to shape it all. CRPGs in particularly really take those points to heart, but I've always found them a little hard to get into. Baldur's Gate 3 takes that focus, turns up the choices, the reactivity, and also turns up the production values to make an easily accessible, but still super deep RPG where the world reacts to your choices. And you have a ton of freedom on what to do. It's mind boggling. Add to that, well written characters and quests, and you have the GOTY for 2023.",0.1

"Melhor jogo da Larian e um dos melhores RPG's da atualidade, muita diversidade de maneiras de jogar com bastante classes e subclasses, a história é ótima e te prende do inicio ao fim e os desenvolvedores além de ouvir o feedback dos jogadores trazem melhorias rapidamente para o jogo, muito diferente de outros estúdios desse tamanho. Este jogo não vai agradar a todos devido ao combate por turno mas deveria receber uma chance por todos que gostam bastante de RPG's",0.1
An absolute masterpiece. What a feeling to finally again play a game that bleeds passion while also circumventing many of the modern gaming pitfalls. It's up there with The Witcher 3 for best and most immersive RPG I've ever played.,0.1

is an epic and masterful gaming experience that unquestionably deserves a perfect 10. This review aims to justify this rating by highlighting the aspects that make the game a masterpiece in the RPG genre.,0.1
"It's simple. This game showed us how good a game can be in 2023. Not like Bethesda, Ubisoft, Activision, Blizzard, companies with tons of resources but with no quality standards.",0.1
,0.1
"Larian really knows how to make their games feel so dang immersive and well put together. This one, no doubt, is the biggest and most kick-ass game ever made.",0.1
"BG3 is the pinnacle of CRPG and RPG, in an era where publishers are looking for more and more ways to make money from their unfinished, generic and lacking in depth games. BG3 represents a transcendental milestone in games, where the player can interact with any NPC in a high quality cutscene, whether in visual and/or voice acting, where talking to a random vendor NPC, you become attached to the charisma of the character in a few minutes. With an unparalleled depth of dialogue, choices, and gameplay, BG3 is a triumph unseen in gaming history in every possible way.",0.1

"""Generation's Game"" was my gateway into the Baldur's saga, and what an entrance it was. The depth it adds and the experience it brings to the D&amp;D tabletop is spectacular. It's a shame about the level 12 cap and perhaps some lack of optimization in ACT3, but that would be nitpicking at this point.",0.09
"I can't give this game a 10 because of some basic oversights by Larian. e.g. no ""gruff voice"" option in character creation spoiling the roleplaying of any dwarf or half-orc for me. Would be a good DLC to add.",0.09
"When looking back at Larian's works, the most interesting part is gameplay. And they did it very well again. 3A standard also made fantastic experience. But there is something missing, something very important when playing CRPG --- Story. I'm not talking about setting or others. There is no twist no epic no memorable moment in this game. I'm feeling like tourist visiting Baldur's Gate. Quite a view! But that's all.",0.09
"A new age of CRPG starts with one that stands above all its predecessors in terms of overall quality. While some might argue that Planescape keeps the crown for plot, there are few games, or media projects in general, that can meet the heights of cinematic immersion, character development and accessible yet enjoyable gameplay which are demonstrated by BG3.",0.1
"This is the best game I've played in the last 20 years. It's such an immersive experience with a compelling story that'll lead anyone, even those who are not familiar with top-down CRPGs will LOVE.",0.1
"Some games are beautiful, some are good, some are well-written, some are all about interactivity, some about great lore... But sometimes, rarely, some write the history of the video game industry and set new standards, BG3 being one of them.",0.1

I would reccomend this game to every gamer. The story is very intriguing, the combat is more then fun. Graphics are beautiful and you can truly see the devs put a lot of effort in this game. It all works so well. Not only do they listen to their fans, they go beyond. It is a pinnacle **** in a time where a lot of anticipated games disappointed or straight up failed and I hope more game devs learn from this game. Going back to play right now",0.1

"Great story, in depth characters/building. It's not easy to jump into, which is one reason it's not a 10. The amount of different play styles that can be had is immense. Exploring is rewarding. The characters side stories and surprisingly meaningful. I like the linear feel with since it allows the devs to tailor the atmosphere to what's going on in the story. Open world games struggle with this and everything just blends in and the story just revolves around big areas that end up looking and feeling the same. Decision making is HUGE. Very few games pull this off. Pc to ps5 is amazing. Overall I'm happy and can talk forever.",0.09

"With so much to do in such a large landscape, it is very easy for hours to pass by in the blink of an eye. My first crpg was divinity original sin and I could not get into it, no matter how many times I tried. BG3 had me hooked instantly. With such beautiful environments, cool story and most importantly, amazing characters that I actually care about. I have even enjoyed the turn based combat…once I learned the strategy of it all. Great game! The only thing that stops me from giving it a ten is the annoying turn based combat with the environment. Many times you can exit that mode of play, but it is pretty annoying for this to even be a thing…a turn base puzzle of ****?",0.09

"This game has a lot of options for dealing with a single situation, and is diverse in terms of endings and  different play styles. Yet in terms of terms based combat as a general mechanism, this game has no real innovation whatsoever. Once I’ve become used to the cliche CRPG narrative, the story stops being interesting. The major frame of the game, so to speak, is weak and balance is the off, so it has to introduce a lot of other “decorative elements” to cover this fundamental flaw. Overall a highly overrated game and not nearly as good as other people seem to regard it.",0.04
"It is breathtaking. They need to work on act 3 but besides that the game is a piece of art. From world itself across battle system as a classic D&amp;D and last but not least the music which is so good it really takes you into battlefield. There is so much freedom in this game that when you think if some of your idea works, you can try it and in most cases it works alhtrough in good way or bad way",0.1
"This game has so much depth, loads of customization options, and great replayability, it's worth every penny",0.1
"After 120 hours of game I can conclude that this game is a true masterpiece, is by far the best game of this year. I had also purchased other AAA game early access, well, after play it 2 hours, it is not bad, but I returned to play BG3 with no doubt. A masterpiece.",0.1
"Baldur's Gate 3 is the best CRPG I've ever played in my life. I truly believe that it was worth buying the game at full price. It provides an amazing gaming experience, giving you a sense of freedom like no other. It's absolutely deserving of the highest praise and I hope it gets Game of the Year. 10/10",0.1

"It's not perfect (mostly technical stuff pertaining to game engine and controls), but I simply cannot stop playing this game and the replayability is second to none! This is what major studios should be aiming to acheive. Despite what developers in other studios say, this game does raise the bar for the entire industry and it does so with class!",0.1

The amount of passion and pride this was crafting with comes through at every step, sure its not 100% perfect but given the scope and scale of this, you can overlook those tiny bugs here and there.

Very colorful and interesting characters with a great story. masterpiece. All studios in the world should learn how to make good games and what people expect. Unfortunately, in these times where it's all about getting money from customers, games like BG3 simply don't exist. The game is priced very low for such a huge product that we get in its entirety without any microtransactions. It could easily cost 50-100% more and I would buy it anyway. I hope that Larian will not rest on his laurels and will release as many games as possible. In addition, there is great contact with the community. I would give 11/10 but I can't :)",0.1

The graphics are also good and the large amount of characters and NPCs are great and were made with great detail and passion. The dialogues are also very good and believable.

"As a longtime player of the first two Bioware games, and an even more seasoned D&amp;D player since the days of second edition, with already over 100 hours of gameplay in this third installment, I can't help but proudly claim the unquestionable beauty of this masterpiece.",0.1

This is my first Baldur's Gate game and my first Larian  game but i am having a blast. I have played tons of rpg games but the only game stuck with me was Dragon Age Origins and it was my all time favourite rpg since its release. Baldur's Gate 3 surpassed DAO and became the best game i have ever played in my entire life (i have 500+ games in steam and 50+games on ps4). I want to play Divinity titles after this game and then i will play BG3 again. This game is the ratatouille of videogames. Just grab it and immerse yourself.,0.1
great great game! I’m so happy that I can play this game in my life. Thanks lariat,0.1
Absolute banger of an RPG. Hit me right in the KOTOR feels. This is one of those games I'll still be referencing 20 years from now. So much replayability. It took me over 100 hours for one playthrough. With branching storylines and dialogue and experiences that react differently to your race and class choices. This is easily a 1000+ hour game if you really want to see and do everything there is to do.,0.1

I have not played Baldur's Gate 1 or 2, so I cannot comment on how the story and game-play holds up to those, however the feel of the game is great, it looks really good graphically and gives me everything I could have ever wanted in terms of making impact-ful choices within a game.",0.1

"Where to start. Baldur's Gate 3 was gifted to me by a friend while it was in early access. I enjoy incredibly immersive games and for one reason or another, Baldur's Gate 3 has drew me in and isn't letting go. The story, the mechanics, the freedom of choice, all excellent. The turn based combat has been executed very well also and even after I've decided to go to bed or end my game session, it's always ""one more turn"" or ""one more fight"". My only caution is, beware: minutes will turn into hours.",0.1
"O jogo é muito bom, mas é superestimado por uma onda da internet onde os youtuber criaram, o jogo é sim muito bom mas está muito muito longe de ser o melhor de todos os tempo como alguns dizem.",0.08
"Not sure why this game gets so much praise. Boring companions, generic plot, plodding and frustrating combat that offers nothing new. There's an illusion of choice, but a lot of the big decisions stayed the same no mater how what choices I made. It's clear a lot of effort went into it, but it's an average rpg at best. Bioware, Bethesda and Rockstar all offer much deeper and more enjoyable rpgs",0.04

O mapa é divertidíssimo e as missões excepcionais, eu já fiz tanta coisa e ainda tem mais ainda para fazer, estou animado para fazer o 100% dessa obra-prima e já é meu GotY, animado para ver como Baldur's vai se sair no TGA.",0.1

"It is without a doubt that the game in question will receive the title of ""Game of the Year"". The level of detail present in the game is truly remarkable, ranging from the intricacies of the musical score to the staggering 174 hours of cinematic content. Furthermore, the combat system is a flawless adaptation of the original Dungeons and Dragons game. It is perplexing to encounter negative reviews of this game, particularly those from individuals who lack a fundamental understanding of turn-based RPGs. Criticisms regarding the length of combat and the abundance of cutscenes are unfounded and demonstrate a lack of comprehension. It is inappropriate for such individuals to provide reviews if they are unable to grasp the fundamental concepts of the game. It is suggested that they instead play games such as Call of Duty.",0.1
"I can't state enough how happy I am to see a game developer not push insane micro-transactions(free to play games don't count as this is a full price game) and actually release a game while not perfect, very well polished enough for me to have almost 100 hours of playtime before even hitting any real bug issues which they are already fixed/still fixing rapidly. AMAZING. i haven't had this much fun in a an RPG in years. This is even more fun than even Skyrim was for me. Only into the beginning parts of act 3 on my solo campaign, but its amazing to me and i have multiple campaigns that i have been running over 150 hours at this point.",0.1
"So I love RPGs but man this one just grabs you. I usually play a game and even though I am enjoying it I am at an age where depression starts affecting me so this game has hit that itch and It is extremely immersive to the point where I am able to play it and enjoy myself.  Onto the game.  It is very intricate obviously with all the different styles, choices, and paths you can choose.  The combat is fun and the story is excellent. You can also play with up to 3 other people!  Also it is very long with no fluff which I love!!! I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone!",0.1

"Baldur's Gate 3 is the best game I've played lately.Although it is a turn-based game, I played for hours without getting bored.",0.1
"I see a lot of negative scores here based on combat feeling slow, story feeling linear, companions being annoying and the game not being open enough. I for one am an avid fan of D&amp;D and have spent hours writing backstories or characters I never will play because I love the fantasy world. BG3 gives me absolutely everything I could ever want from a D&amp;D video game, choices do matter despite other reviews saying they do not (they have not played long enough to feel the impacts). The game is not perfect, it does need technical improvements especially in act 2 and 3 but if you want to the Dungeons and Dragons and don't have a group to play with, well this game is everything you could want. Now I understand this type of game is not for everyone, for example I absolutely hate every first person shooter in every form but some of those games are well liked by millions of people however it is simply not a type of game I enjoy, everyone has their preferences. The Final Fantasy remake removed the turn based combat and I hated it and stopped playing within an hour, it is not a bad game, in fact is a beautiful well designed game but it is not for me. BG3 tells an engaging story that you need to invest time into, I am not on my second playthrough because there are so many choices I want to change to see how the story unfolds. I have already bought this game 3 times and would pay full price every time I start a new playthrough, that is how much I love this game but Larian did the unthinkable and made this game 100% offline and DRM free with so many meaningful side quests that you would not see unless you explore the zones. We literally get side quests from speaking to animals (fully voiced by the way) but easily missed as it isn't required to progress the story. This takes me back to my comment about investing time. I appreciate the level of detail put into expanding almost every NPC's backstory. Do you want to know what happened to that one NPC you saved back in act 1? Well find them again in act 3 and find out, might not be as exciting as instant gratifying demon slaying in Diablo but I want to know that NPC's story. Again this is everything I ever wanted in a video game because it is for gamers like me. You want COD go play COD that is for you not for me.",0.09

"One of the best games I have played in a while. I really had a fun playing playing this game. It has some problems like performance issues bugs etc but I those are forgivable and not game breaking. I am sure they will fix those very soon. The only reason I give 9 is because of the act 3 and the ending it provides. You might have seen some ""cut"" content on the internet and the ending really leaves a bad after taste. After playing for more 100 hours you can feel that the ending is really underwhelming and missing. I think the reason for that is they had to release it a month earlier due to starfield.  I am not sure when but they will probably make the ending better(probably within this year). Act 1 and Act 2 really increases your expectations about the ending but when you come to act 3 you become very disappointed. I would still recommend the game though because it is very fun to play. I think they made this game very newcomer friendly. You don't need to know anything about dnd to enjoy the game.",0.09

"Baldur’s gate 3 is an amazing game, an absolutele masterpiece. The graphics, voice acting, music, story, gameplay and the dnd adaptation- everything is top notch. I cannot believe some people give this game a 0/10. The only explanation is that they hate fun. If you’re a person how likes fun - this is the game for you.",0.1
"Fantastic game, it's everything I've always dreamt about since I was a kid playing D&amp;D!",0.1

Starts strong but the bug filled rushed ending  really takes away from the whole experience. Worth a playthru if you enjoy turn-based crpgs but don't expect a masterpiece.,0.06

"I bought the game to support good game Designing. I wish I could see more of my familiar Forgotten Realms I used to know from Baldurs Gate 1 and 2, Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights. Maybe something changed in d&amp;d 5.0 I'm not aware. But keep going with good work.",0.1
"This game implemented all my dreams about a good game in the Dungeon and Dragons setting. I completed this game in one breath and want to replay it. I like that this game is cheap and has tons of content, you can jump, fly, teleport, push enemies into the abyss, and see nudity. The world is filled with interesting items, objects, and NPCs. This game doesn't have microtransactions. Developers deserve the highest rewards.  This game is really the best thing I have ever played and I don't believe that such a great game was created in such a bad time.",0.1
"I did 3 runs and still find new things and dialogues in the 4th; The items in-game doesn't cost money!!! No Microtransaction nor Macrotransaction!! This game should be the standard, don't waste money!",0.1

"This game is a dream come true. Being a fan of Larian's former games I really wanted to play more and this one does not leave me dry. Graphics are beautiful and so clean. Everything you do is amplified to the max and your story that you are building with your choices comes alive because of that. Sound design is a masterpiece once again, I cannot really give enough praise for it. Having to experience it from the beginning of the EA, I can really appreciate the hard work behind it and how much more we players were given to the release. I'm a fan of turn-based combat and I love to take my time for it, thinking all varieties to go forward so I cannot say a bad word for it. I understand that it's really not for anyone, just like real-time combat isn't fun for me. I still think players can adapt to it quite nicely. This game has been a real treat and I have booked 200 hours already, and there is plenty of hours more to come. I love how one playthrough leaves so many stones unturned for the next ones to reveal them.",0.1

Entire story lines won't happen bro, so calm down, sit the **** back, and really get into every choice you make without worrying about what could happen if you chose differently. Because EVERY playthrough WILL hold new surprises and introduce you to entirely different sides and perceptions about the different scenarios and characters you encounter.  10 out of ****g 10.",0.1

"This is the way games used to be made before the industry stopped making art and started making ""products"" with microtransactions. This game made my year. I thought I was getting tired of gaming when I was just tired of gaming as it is now. I miss eating because I'm so engrossed in the world. Last time a game had me so hooked was Mass Effect 2. Or KOTOR. Game of the year, easily.",0.1
"One of the biggest and most fun RPG's you could possibly play. There are so many things you can do, so much choices to make. Every quest feels like it has a thousand different endings, every NPC a million interactions. There's so many small things that can affect what you can do, or how things play out. It's absolutely insane. Genuinely one of the most immersive games around.",0.1

A beautiful story with so many choices that lead to multiple opportunities and consequences the game is a true RPG masterpiece! Loving every minute of this game!,0.1
"Best RPG of our time. Absolutely amazing story-telling, reactivity, replayability, and just all around fun. It's absolutely massive in scope. It should still be up there in Metacritic's top 10 games of all times, unfortunately you get a bunch of entitled idiots who can review bomb with 0s that have no basis in reality, with absurd hyperbolic reasoning. If the game is not for you, that's no reason to give false scores because user issues, rather than issues with the actual game.",0.1
"This is not my usual preferred genre ****, but I absolutely loved it! It's easily in my top ten games of all time.",0.1
"Game of the decade. Incredible story, infinite options, amazing. And to do this in a consumer friendly way is a vanishingly rare thing in the industry.",0.1
"I don't think I have enjoyed myself playing any game this much in so long. That's not to say I haven't enjoyed playing other games, but Baldur's Gate 3 just stands on out so much that other games by comparison can't hold a candle. Larian has done such a great job at bring the forgotten realms to life in this game, and giving a d&amp;d experience. It stays true to  5e while giving it a polish that balances out the game, and provides quality of life improvements well suited for a video game version of the d&amp;d. This game looks great, the story is engaging, and the volume of choices you have on how to play is absolutely massive. Sure the game has its bugs and other issues, but those are far overshadowed by the clear time and effort Larian put into delivering us this masterpiece.",0.1

"A master piece. Only thing I don't like is the excess of humour ( too much undead NPCs in the city interacting with normal people like if this is a normal thing) and the music. The main theme of baldurs 3 is bad, not as epic as baldurs Gate 1 or baldurs Gate 2 main theme. That theme was memorable.",0.1

Despite all of this i decided to give this game a chance, best decision ever... This game is absolutely incredible. The plot is interesting, story telling top notch, dialogues are allways on point and they never gives you more information than you need, tons and tons of different choices to give your story a totally original direction, absolute freedom to explore the map, because we've allways seen walls that you cannot trespass sometime you don t get that you can go over, as i said absolute freedom. Graphic is enjoyable and clean. Combat system? I freakin' love it, i never get bored of experiment, and try new strategies and the fact that is based on D&amp;D makes me feel at home. This Baldur's Gate 3 deserves the 2023's GOTY.",0.1

Every character has something to give and some of the random stuff that happens is so cool. Frame rates are consistent and the game has been running great on my PC.

Been a while since I sat at work thinking about a game!",0.1

"I find it very funny how you can go on the negative reviews and almost none of them say anything true about the game, sure some of them give some feedback but thats very rare. There's a ton of 0/10 to balance the game, or people rating it 0 while rating diablo 4 an 8 (after the season 1 patch) or someone rating every game thats impacted culture 0, 1 or 2. Its honestly great. As for the actual game, act 1 and 2 are damn near perfect, im not a big fan of crpgs but this game feels so smooth that its easy to pick up, cutscenes are perfect, story is good and bug free for the most part. The problem is with act 3. The amount of bugs in act 3 could bring this down to an 8 or 9 but its Larian. I trust theyll fix these bugs (none of them are game breaking mind you (at least in my path)). Most games have 10x more bugs with a bigger development team and a small scope.

"Ignore anyone giving this absolute master-class in how to create a story driven RPG less than 5. They have no idea what they are talking about and must've played something made by Blizzard...with battle passes, microtransctions, bloated **** gameplay that gets nerfed each season to limit how much fun players get to have, there is only the slog that only wants to maintain your engagement in their chore lists not your entertainment. Baldurs gate 3 is just phenomenal. Turn based combat, exploration, and dialogue focused scenes are basically the main aspects you'll be dealing with. If you don't like that combination just give this one a miss, it's not for you. I've played through twice, both with custom characters. The 2nd being the dark urge origin. My 1st play through I went down the morally good alignment saving people from the baddies and such and it was amazing, there was so many quests and party members to speak with, finding allies who would be in the camp to speak with later for additional lore and dialogue rounding out their smaller quests. The finale of my 1st run was great and I enjoyed the ending I got. The whole marketing thing of 17k endings obviously isn't true there are slight differences and variables dependent on your choices but largely you'll get a handful of endings. I wish there was more of an epilogue for the characters I spent the last 50+ hours with but you get a few final scenes that close of some things and leave others with some speculation. My only complaint is the dark urge and going for an evil, succumbing to this origin characters dark desires often results in a very evil run albeit to some gruesome moments and I dove right in, but this resulted in a smaller number of allies I could choose for my party, losing karlach and wyll because of the choice I made in act 1 provides you with 1 replacement of an enemy turned friend in act 2. Act 3 in my 1st run left me with so much to do in the way of quests but on my dark urge there were was not as many in comparison,  but this is . I definitely had more fun in combat with my dark urge, being evil and resorting to violence has some pretty good rewards if you follow it to completion. All in all I've put over 130 hours not including my early access playtime which was about 30 hours and this game is one of the best ever made. For RPG lovers. A welcome change from the never ending live service pieces of **** that have clogged up the industry of late. Triple A Developers should be worried because this is now the standard for RPGs whether they like it or not. The next dragon age, mass effect or whatever else comes out should be compared to BG3.",0.1

"Baldurs Gate 3 is the single most dedicated, enjoyable, and thought out RPG I've ever played. The mechanics of it are vast, the story choices and roleplay options available to players is second to none. While the game undoubtedly as its bugs, an issue no dev team seems immune to, the fact of it that for a AA studio to put our a game that brings players more fun and entertainment than what the likes of even the top tier AAA studios seem to be capable of, is a fantastic feat. With some extra love and care, something I believe Larian is absolutely capable of putting in, I imagine BG3 is going to have a strong running to be Game of the Year for many, many players.",0.1

"I've been playing RPGs since late 90's and couldn't drive myself into anything descent since late 2000s. This particular title wasn't any promising to me until a friend of mine asked for playing together and I lost myself to Faerûn for 2 weeks+ completing every quest, investigating through each dungeon like back then when I was a child. This game revived my interest to RPG (and turn-based action) genre. BG3 has beatiful storytelling, nice grpahics, exceptional voice acting, challenging fights. It's not pretending to be a ""yet dark grim fantasy game full of cliched characters"" yet indeed everyone could find some comedy and drama in it, a story of your own. And due to vast replayability I'm 100% sure there are a couple more adventures waiting for me there",0.1

You know there is something special about a game when people who usually won't play a turn based game are playing it and enjoying. The amount of effort behind the game and it's size is something exceptional nowadays. This game has everything you want in a RPG and was able to translate very well the D&amp;D 5e system into it. The vast world give you many reasons to explore it and there are many interesting stories to be uncovered.

It's understandable the game might feel overwhelming at the start, but man once you get the hang of it, it's just amazing. Everything about the game is perfect. And it's fine if you save before rolling the dice, we all do it. :p",0.1
"I'm finding that I am not a fan of clunkily moving around by mouse clicks, and BG3 has a steep learning curve if you've never played a turn based/D&amp;D style game before. It seriously needs a tutorial for newbs with no prior experience in this style of game. The lack of a decent quest tracking system is also frustrating. Worst though are the game killing bugs, like suddenly being permanently encumbered after the patch, even if you dump your entire inventory down to your skivvies. Suggested online fixes like ""kill yourself and then pay 200 gold to revive"" aren't a fix at all. There is a game here to like, but it would be a lot more likeable if they had made it more friendly to new players, and of course squashed the game killing bugs.",0.06
"The best game I've played since The Witcher 3 in 2016, I daresay my experience with Baldur's Gate 3 is even better. Masterfully crafted world with superb storyline that can be told in more ways than one and it will still be miraculously coherent by the end of it.",0.1

The story and gameplay are both enjoyable and there are many customizable builds and optional paths which affect the game. The only issue is I face some game breaking bugs in chapter 3 of the game and I think it needs some polish. Other than that everything has been great!,0.09

We won’t forget and I will continue supporting studios producing what we want, not what they think will make them more money.",0.1

"One of the best RPG's ive ever played. Bought day one, didn't even need to check the reviews. Never played early access. Never watched any lets play's. i just knew with Larians track record and the fact they were willing to leave this game on early access for YEARS, just to make sure the game was polished and exactly the way they wanted it, shows their devotion to making a good D&amp;D/baldurs gate faithful RPG. Cant recommend this game enough, for sure my game of the year and i dont see that changing.",0.1

You will wind up with a product you dont understand and cant use. every time i roll the dice i lose, this game ****.",0.0

"This game really has all for a CRPG type of game. The only downside is that the combat is way too slow-paced due to being turn-based. Would've want realtime with pause like the earlier BG games, at least as an option (kinda like how Arcanum works). Beside that, everything is really great. And the story is really awesome and funny too. It's like KOTOR and Dragon Age Origins on crack.",0.1

Despite what some industry folks say, this absolutely sets a new standard for the entire industry and it is one in which the player stands to benefit from a refreshing departure from predatory, stores-as-games development models and corporate greed.  Larian deserves all the accolades they receive from this title and I can't wait to see more from this studio.  Stop reading reviews and go play the game!",0.1

The game is just fun in general. With plenty of storied characters to choose from, as well as custom characters for a more unique playthrough. The dialogue, branching paths, and even online multiplayer will have you not just excited to finish your story but to begin your next one immediately after. This is an example **** done extremely well, and we can only hope beyond hope to get more games like it. Well worth the price of purchase, as I can't see anyone finding a reason to hate the game. In fact I believe this is one of those titles that several years later will have people delving into it's many stories and secrets.",0.1

This is not just the greatest CRPG ever made, it is the greatest game overall. The only credibility to the argument that this game is ""too good"" is found in the truth that if you play this game, you will struggle to enjoy any RPG that isn't this one for quite some time afterward.",0.1

Sounds and music perfect. I think I was annoyed at how the level and sub-levels were done. How some areas are extremely easy, while others really hard. And how the autosave seems to forget to save in a span of 30 minutes and more. I give it 75% but to be fair, I had trouble liking the game in Early access and at it's release.

Best game ever. Played divinity 2 and genuinely thought that was one of the best games I have ever played and this genuinely tops that.,0.1
An excellent game with a world full of every kind of stories and adventures. When you think the game wont appeal the main stream gamers it had 800k real time online players on steam. The dialogs arent that long and are not hard to read. They are simple and clean. And the things you can do are countless. It was the best game ive played in last couple of years.,0.1
"BG3 got interesting characters and deep, complex, diverse storytelling with uncountable real choices. Also. Larian has elevated the cRPG genre to another level with its fully voice-acted cinematic presentation. There are bugs but the studio works hard to fix them and anyone who knows Larian is sure they fix everything. I dare to claim that BG3 overall is the best cRPG ever created so far.",0.1
"I love this game. The graphics, voice acting and the animations are top notch. It made getting into this CRPG very easy after learning some of the rules. I like Divinity Sin II, this game is much easier to get into turn base combat. I’ve played many RPGs and this is my first CRPG that I intend to complete. I am constantly amazed by the eta the world and story is shaped by your decisions. The world is very reactive dependent on your class and race. The sound and music is very impressive. Makes me happy to get fully immersed. Inventory management is supported by nice music that makes it not feel like a chore and instead helps I feel relaxed and inspired. I recommend that for your first gameplay you do not reload game saves. Instead embrace the evolving storyline. A good choice may lead to bad outcomes and bad choices may lead to pleasant surprises. This game will have a lot of replay value. Do not hesitate and buy this game and enjoy the journey.",0.1

The amount of interactivity and creativity that this game allows is truly enormous. I believe that this has absolutely lifted the bar on what RPG's can be and if other video game developers dispute this or feel bad about it then they can just make better games and stop trying to nickel and dime the players.,0.1

However, this game feels like playing in a tabletop D&amp;D game with that jerk of a DM who tries way too hard to kill you, and is way too much of a stickler for everything. ""Oh, you didn't SAY you were walking through the fire? Well that was the shortest path so now you're burning!"" It also has some really annoying bugs, and the UI leaves a lot to be desired, and honestly the animations are pretty bad too. Also all the NPCs are jerks for some reason.

"Do you know how good it is to not have to feel obligated or forced to play a video game? And just play a video game because you like it you want to see where the story goes? I usually have a battle pass on the go on one of my favorite games and I never realized until I bought bg3 how mentally debilitating it is. I never realized how much I hate Bible passes and how much they try to steal my own time and force me to play their game. If your game is good enough, I won't have to buy a battle pass to be invested in it.     Baldur's Gate 3 is the best, most expansive game I've played in my 26 years of life and 13 years of gaming. It has the most freedom of choice in every in any game that has ever been released in the history of gaming. The voice acting is absolutely incredible, the soundtrack is on par if not better than all of Indiana jones, Star wars and lord of the rings movies put together. It is honestly an honour to be able to play this game. Yes, I will expect more out of video games coming in the future. I will not be pre-ordering anything until I see the reviews, I will not be purchasing any battle passes as they are a scummy way to steal my time and force me to play your game. If your game relies on scummy practices such as selling skins and bundles to make money I have news for you, go make a better game. I don't understand how idiotic developers can be in this day and age to look at larian and scream at them, it's like doing terrible in a subject at school and then get angry at the smart kid for getting a 90 lmao. When I say you can make choices in this game, I don't mean that you can say yes or no and that will change the story in two different ways, you will have various conversations with a single character that will influence that character's outcome in the hours and hours and hours to come, not just one thing that will happen one time and be done with. If you're worried about replayability with this game, let me tell you that I have MOSTLY played early access things and I'm still discovering new ways to handle different situations, I'm still discovering brand new areas that I've never even thought to go before, I've had new conversations and dialogue and cinematics on that I didn't even think existed because in my limited gamer's mind there's no way that a developer could add this many contingencies!!! I love Baldur's Gate 3 and I appreciate the respect Larian has for me. AAA developers, if you're wondering how Larian is going to make it more money I will tell you. Instead of me purchasing $160 worth of skins in your game that are completely useless to everyone but me (and also completely useless to me if the live service game shuts down) I will properly utilize my money to buy two more copies of Baldurs Gate 3,  give them to my friends and be able to play with them now. In a year? I'll probably buy it again for another friend that I'm sad hasn't played it. Thank you for not making this a free to play a game, a game with a battle pass or a store Larian.

"It's my first CRPG game and the best game of my life. If you play it yourself, it will be more than anything you imagine.  It's a game that makes me wonder if I've lived to play Baldur's Gate, and I think GOTY will definitely get it this year, and I think it will be remembered as a game that will go down in history. This game has made me a huge fan of Larian, and I think I will trust and buy Larian games in the future.",0.1

"After 200+ hours playing the game, I'm still having a lot of fun and trying out different comps and specs. The only thing I would still like to see is VA for player's avatar in Dialogues (I think it makes the exchanges even more immersive) and more characteristic VA for Half-Orcs, Dwarfs, Dragonborn etc. (i.e. races that diverge a lot from the standard human form).",0.1

"Combat is incredibly slow, even the smallest skirmishes drag on forever. The dialogue is fan fiction levels of awful. The companions are either annoying or not in any way interesting. To top it off, the entire game is extremely sordid and full of degenerated nonsense. It is very sad to see what Larian has done with the Baldur's Gate IP. Never again.",0.0

"This game is practically one of a kind these days. We have gained so much in the last couple of decades of gaming, so much in technical achievements, but games seem to have lost their souls in the process, well not this game, this game may not be the most technically impressive of latest years, although it's no slouch either, but it delivers so much more, not just by modern gaming standards, but by the standards that made so many of us fall in love with gaming in the first place, the kind of standards that birthed your favourite games from decades past. If this game's soul manages to infect at least one more developer/publisher to be better, it will have already done more for gaming that every single executive and share holder in the industry in the last 12 years, and that both invigorates as much as it saddens.",0.1
"This game is massive, and I'm in for the long run. The questing, characters, world, RNG, encounters, graphics, sound design... It's all great! I've run into a few bugs and issues, unfortunately dragging down the score a point, but in almost 80 hours of play I can comfortably say this might be my favorite RPG of the year.",0.09

"This game recaptures the magic I had when playing Bioware’s Dragon Age Origins in terms of scale, repalayability and players’ choice. No parts of it felt like a filler, it was well written and voice acted and the game feels like a once a decade game, similar to how I feel about other RPGs like Tyranny and Disco Elysium. Larian is now the standards bearer for the entire CRPG genre and a landmark moment for all of us.",0.1
"I'm in my fourties now and I had my fair share of RPGs in my time. No really I do have the time and the resources to play games pretty much as much as I want to. I've been there during Ultima 1-8, Eye of the Beholder, Wizardry, Fallout, Daggerfall, Baldurs Gate 1+2, Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Wasteland series, Icewind Dale, Planescape and of course Dragon Age, Mass Effect, Jade Empire, Solasta, Expeditions Series, Pillars and **** that I think about it, I guess I really played them all. Seriously that's a lot of games. However, disregarding my life choices, BG3 is exactly what I wanted from the successor of one of my favorite games. Is it perfect? No, nothing is. Is it one if the best RPGs ever? Yes. Yes it is. To this day I know what I did in Daggerfall. I remember what I did in Dragon Age and I get goosebumps listening to the Mass Effect OST. And I'm looking forward to remember my time in BG3 in the same way. Only thing bothering me is the fact that I can't get the BG1 soundtrack out of my had and Larian actually didn't use any part of that.",0.1
"I never played any games like this before. I'm blown away, has to be one of the best games I've ever played.",0.1
"Who would have thought that making an enjoyable non-scummy predatory half-finished cash grab would be a good idea huh. I'm not saying that this should be standard in term of scope, grandeur and polish. It should however be a standard for ""what a game should feel like at launch"". A finished product, not designed to milk your wallet, not designed to further some agenda, please shareholders or meet enforced deadlines. When the studio cares for their players' experience, it shows. THAT is the standard we want this game to set, and not what other developers whine about. Its not about scope, length. Its about decency, care and respect towards your customers",0.1
"Game is full of bugs and irritating mechanics, creators of UI didn't deliver mostly. This game is very annoying.",0.03
Pure freedom to make whatever choices you want and your choices actually affect the story. Your free to kill main charachter allies whenever you want and just continue through the game if you want.,0.1
Made an account just for this. I don’t think I’ll be able to enjoy another rpg after this. Just so damn good.,0.1
"I've already spent about 70 hours in this game and after finishing the first playthrough, I'm thrilled with how awesome it is. Of course I was hyped before the release and was waiting to finally check it out. And I'm so mega glad that Larian put all their heart into this title and it really shows. The dialogues, the stories, the character designs and their plots, the voice acting, the immersive world and beautiful graphics, and the real flexibility of the gameplay - these are, in my opinion, the most visible pluses of this game. Well, and from me, I'll also say that the biggest blink of an eye was that you can play an evil character, in the sense of, for real, an evil villain. You don't come across that too often in games, so I respect that XD. I honestly think this game will live on for a long time, looking at the growing modder scene and the opening of the game to modifications. I would like to thank Larian for this game, because we probably won't soon meet another studio that creates AAA RPGs with such passion and detail.",0.1
Easily one of the best and most well-crafted RPGS of all time. It's clear Larian really cares about the game and the community.  chef's kiss,0.1

"I've been hoping for something like Elders Scrolls after being disappointed in the online game. This game should make AAA producers shame into actually making games people love and can play.  Anyone for an attempt at Diablo 4 or Cyberpunk 2077 that needed a year to become a shadow of the game promised. Makes me sick. I have refused to pay 60-70 USD for a game that needs so much work everyone waits for the 1.1 release to play it. BG3 is the first game since Elder's Scrolls that I paid full price. And at a better price, no stupid **** of users and THIS SHOULD BE the state of the art for all AAA games. Not just RPG. Why should a AAA studio expect users to accept their crappy code, their **** with microtransactions and other **** Why can't they put out a polished game? Because instead of games people love the publisher just wants money flowing in like a cut jugular. And so impressive that Larian did not receive backing and put the company at risk putting this out. Companies controlled by publishers put out what they are forced to put out. Shame the publishers!!!",0.1
Larian have outdone themselves. Haven't felt this way playing a new game in a long time. Thank you Larian for your hard work and passion. It really shows.,0.1
"I am not one for turn based games, they tend to be my least enjoyed style of game and I usually avoid them. However I knew of the game for a couple years and waited till it came out to play it and to form my opinion on it, and I find it absolutely amazing. This game along with Elden Ring are the only games that I find more than worth the time to play and money to spend on. I have 117 hours and I have only barely scratched the surface of the 3rd act so far. I find the story to be very good, I also really enjoy the characters and companions of the game as I find them to act more like actual people than bots willing to do whatever you want on a whim. The combat is probably the only thing I can see being an issue for people, I know turn based combat isn't for everyone, and some of the reviews on here show that, but I was of a similar mind before playing this game thinking I would never enjoy a game with turn based combat. Then I played the game and it completely changed my mind. I obviously wouldn't recommend this game to someone who absolutely hates turn based games no matter how good every other aspect of the game is, but having been on the side of not enjoying turn based games that much to (at least) absolutely loving this game I can say with some confidence that I would recommend it to someone that might be on the fence about it, especially if multiplayer is involved, I personally haven't tried it with a few of my friends yet but from what I've heard and the few videos I've seen it looks phenomenal. Overall I cant emphasize how much I would recommend this game. It is simply just the torch in the dark of all the OK to sub-par games that have come out over the past few years.",0.1
"I am mostly giving my review based on the game soundtrack, but nonetheless I have seen multiple videos and multiple moments where this game delivers something truly special. An occasion for the player to get lost in this world. The soundtrack is absolutely mind blowing.

I have been playing this every chance I have. All the options you can take and ways you can progress makes it feel like a real DnD campaign. Slowly becoming my new favorite game!!,0.1
"No amount of good core concepts and followthrough can fix what is a fundamentally broken game. BG3 is chock-full of bugs of all sorts that make the game quite literally unplayable, and they only get progressively worse as your save file bloats and time goes on. By the time I reached Act 3, I could no longer progress the main story no matter how many times I reloaded or reinstalled. Madder still, they've been in early access getting free testing for how long yet still could not improve the state of it. I have not played such a buggy game at launch since Arkham City, it is miserable. I suspect all the people reviewing positively are not actually far into the game, only seeing the turoial and early areas which have the most polish (yet are still pretty janky). Either that or people are simply lying to themselves about how functional it is. No game should allow you to fall through the world and hardlock you from progressing at launch, I don't care how rocky development was. BG3 is fundamentally broken and I can't in good conscience rate it higher unless they fix it. It is truly sad, as the core gameplay and story are genuinely great.",0.0

"This game has so much opportunity, features, customization, etc that its absurd. Many games try to be deceptive and act like there's a lot of choices or ways to change the story through your own actions when in reality most dialogue options mean **** all. This game actually delivers on that and so much more. Because of this game I've been able to get friends to get it and even be willing to actually get into DnD and do a campaign together. This might actually be one of THE games of this gen and for sure Larian deserves to get GOTY for BG3. Also unlike other GOTY contenders like Hogwarts Legacy, TOTK, or Diablo 4 its easy to put support behind because Larian doesn't have a history basked in all sorts of isms, doesn't copyright strike random people over OSTs or less, and they refuse to add microtransactions to their game. This is one of the few times where people are actually delivering what gamers want without any catch and I'm just grateful to Larian for that.",0.1

When I start playing Baldur’s Gate I was immediately hooked. The story and the world is so exciting. You want to explore everything and every npc you meet has an interesting story to tell. For me it had the same feeling as The Witcher 3 in scope of the world and characters you meet. And that was an action based game. I tried playing turn based games before but I never had the patience for this type of games. But for Baldur’s Gate 3 the combat is exciting and when a fight is over I have this feeling of accomplishment. I am happy I did try playing this game. Also the replayability is the best. No future game will be the same with all the different classes and dialogue options you can choose from. For me this will be a game that I can play in many years to come and never be bored of it! Therefore 10/10!,0.1

To other studios: maybe if you'd spend time making a fun, rich, satisfying game instead of focusing on how to monetize the ever living **** out of them you could achieve such greatness as Larian did.

Bref il faut y jouer vraiment , ça serait louper une expérience que de ne pas essayer ou d'avoir peur du système du jeu qui peut faire peur même pour les néophytes (jamais jouer a de jeu de rôle papier ou autre Baldur / divinity etc) . Foncez ! Larian Studio je vous aime et merci pour votre jeu",0.1

"It's quite entertaining to witness the critics of those youngsters from the 20s who are solely engrossed in Fortnite and never heard of DnD, pointing fingers at this game, labeling it as excessively cinematic and overly drenched in narrative intricacies, rather than a game of fast-paced combat action.

"49 yrs young here, started on a C64 with Ghostbusters as one of the first games that I fell in love with. It had a cool progression  and upgrade mechanic but you had to load it from a Cassette Deck! Anyone under the age of 40 can google that last bit. I played the original BG and BG 2 and I can say that BG3 is honestly one of the best Games I've ever played. Not to mention its a complete gaming experience out of the box! Larian Studios have shown the rest of the industry that you can make a great game that's a financial success, which doesn't treat their player base like blood bags of cash while they Vampire like **** us dry of our hard earned cash with Microtransactions, Loot Boxes etc etc. Everyone at Larian who worked on this, My Gratitude is boundless.

Player choice is bar none. Player freedom is bar none. Combat is lots of fun without becoming overly complex. And the story is a hoot and a riot. What more can you ask for? Oh yeah, it is also - somehow - a 100+ hour experience. Once in a decade kind ****. Once in a lifetime kind of game once Act III bugs are ironed out.",0.1

In addition, the graphics engine that made Divinity Original Sin so famous is unrivaled in the world of CRPGs, allowing us to interact with almost every object on the map, climb mountains and buildings, fly, fill the stage with flames and frost, and much more.

It is the greatest RPG . The game is overflowing with crossroads, with every step conjuring up yet more paths trying to seduce you off the beaten track. Each of the three acts could be their own epic RPG, jam-packed with elaborate dungeons, strikingly memorable quests and unique stakes, supported by systems that offer a truly intimidating amount of player freedom.

"Although I've been a long time DnD fan, since it began in the 70's, I have not really played much since my teens, with the last real playtime landing with the ""Gold"" box (Pool of Radiance, Curse of the Azure Bonds, etc.) games and finally Baldur's Gate 1 &amp; 2 upon their initial release. I bought into this a couple of years back but only put a couple of hours in and found I didn't want to ruin the surprise.  So much to learn and find in this game!  This game deserves an 20 out of 10.  Larian devs put so much effort into this game and every time I think I have cleared an area, I go back to find more that I have missed. Wander EVERYWHERE. Go to dead ends. Open everything. All this exploration is on top of the amazingly well spoken and written story lines.  I want to play with every character.  If you are the type of person that might be interested in the story, quests, exploration, and are not turned off by redoing battles, if needed, then PLAY it.  It is the best game of its type to EVER be developed for computers/console - I'm not kidding. It is the top of pile by a huge margin and that's for the last FIFTY (50) years of Dnd. This is a GOD tier Dungeons and Dragons Game.",0.1

Larian's boys deserve the Goty, I think this is the most complete game in recent years, an immense game with lots of things to do but in a world that is never empty and fully enjoyable, if you have never played D&amp;D you will find it slightly complex at all start, but you will get used to it in a few hours of playing I guarantee it!",0.1
"As a crpg fan, baldur's gate 3 is nothing for me where the likes of fallout 1 &amp; 2, arcanum, geneforge and many more exist. But kudos to larian who laid their groundwork from divinity series and executed the basic tropes of crpg well showing the world what true roleplaying is in video games. I was skeptical at first because it deviated lot from the infinity engine games but larian learned all their tricks and made baldur's gate 3 their magnum opus. Barring some flaws, baldur's gate 3 has laid the foundation for more crpg in the future to get recognition and mainstream success",0.1

"So I started playing D&amp;D from the start in 1975 with first edition three pamphlets in the cardboard box.  I played the first two Baldur's Gate games thoroughly over the years.  The other RPGs that I played from Larian Studios were outstanding.  Everything about Baldur's Gate 3 makes it the best computer RPG I have ever played.  The graphics, animations, movies, sounds, world, classes, mobs, gameplay, choices, story, number of outcomes,...  I think anyone who has any interest in electronic role playing games should try Baldur's Gate 3.  It is astonishingly great!  Baldur's Gate 3 is my new measuring stick for all electronic RPGs and it is #1 to me.",0.1

This is the best game I truly found myself immersed in since Witcher 3. I Played countless games after Witcher 3 but none seem to create that feeling of belonging there but this is a masterpiece. Even though I didn't liked the divinity original sin 2 turn based combat but this game is so good that I am even enjoying the turn based combat. Well done Larian Studios,0.1
"All I can say is wow, wow, wow… the team at Larian went all out on this game! It truly is a masterpiece that is going to be fondly remembered. To be honest, it kind of feels like a lovingly made piece of art. Character creation, companions, setting are all incredible, but what makes this stand out is the depth and painstaking detail woven into the quests, gameplay and dialogue that screams masterclass. It’ll probably will take some getting used to for some younger audiences that have been so subjected to increasingly dumbed-down and low-frequency content over the years, but this is something that once they get into it, will surely be a breath of fresh air to them and will be a real treat for that mistreated generation, showing them what epic gaming is about. It’ll hopefully inspire a new generation of budding game developers to reach for the stars, because sometimes someone like Larian actually manages to reach them.",0.1

Maybe my expectation was wrong, as I was expecting the game that would reinvent RPG concepts, but no, it's just an ok game with some cool side quests and some references to Dungeons and Dragons which are cool.

"Absolute stellar game, a masterpiece. Intrinsic stories with a great cast. Visually striking imagery and the world itself. Nuances in its voice-acting and great turn-based gameplay. My only major quibbles are the bugs. It's to no surprise that there will be many in a game of such a scope and Larian (the studio behind the game) are constantly pushing out fixes. Still, it can take you out of the immersion from time to time from cutscenes not appearing to characters walking through walls. The other big downside is sometimes the camera really doesn't know what it's doing in battle and cutscenes at times and it can be a little frustrating, and sometimes downright hilarious. Either way, this game is spectacular and is truly a once in a generation type game. I wish other studios gave as much heart and soul to this game like they do instead of running it into the ground with micro-transactions - which this game is free from anything in-game.

"As a longtime RPG fan and a newcomer to the DnD world, I found Larian’s approach to Baldur’s Gate 3 to be entrancing. The various systems are beginner friendly enough to start with little to no knowledge of 5e rules, while retaining enough complexity to keep learning throughout the experience. The various companions have me peeling their many layers just as the world unravels in front of me, my successes and failures rolling out consequences in a rewarding (or terrifying) way, short or long term. I’m looking forward to my future playthroughs with origin characters immensely, especially with the Dark Urge. The deeply passionate community is sure to provide with amazing guides, mods, builds, etc… which is a godsend not only for lost little lambs like me, first coming to this universe, but also for the future of this game.",0.1
"I have loved RPGs since I was a child, now after 30 years of changes in the PC games market, Baldures Gate 3 has brought me faith that RPG is not a forgotten genre. I'm having a great time with this game! Larian Studios - Respect!",0.1
"As a 3D Game Artist and Game dev, my opinion is simple. It sets new Standarts, the game is made with love, you feel it in every step you make, the player agency in this game is unreal, something no other game ever gave me before. I have not enjoyed a game like this since Witcher 3, or God of war. it is an amazing story, you can play with friends or alone, both are expiriances that are amazing. Get the game. Rate it. GOTY!!!",0.1

"This game is a once in a decade game, there's is too much they do right to get anything less than a 10/10. The graphics are outstanding, the game mechanics are brilliant, but most of all the story telling is second to none. There are so many ways to cook an egg with this game, for example I have been using some walkthrough for some of the quests and I notice that they are telling me a completely different way to beat it, this is because your choices can change each individual quest entirely, to the point each quest is almost tailored to your game. Even to the point of which party members you have in your party at each specific quest can change the outcome and dialogue choices. The spells you learn and play style you adopt will completly change how the game goes for you. This isn't a mass effect style 4 endings in different colours and your choices mean nothing. Every decision you make in this game has the ability to entirely change the story and this is a revolution for gaming, something much bigger developers always promise but never deliver on. Hats off!",0.1

"Not even the powers of a fettered Prince Orpheus could make me resist the urge to play this game. It is as close to a table top D&amp;D adventure as I have ever seen on PC. Characters are fleshed out and eviscerated. I felt that I could play ""F, Carry, Kill"" with everything clickable"". The dialogue options are plentiful without being overwhelming. The combat variety is excellent, ranging from pecker-engorging slaughterfests to cheek-clenching-single-remaining-turn escapes. Graphics are great for the most part with some jank here and there. The continuity with BG1 &amp; BG2 is logical without being overarching. I would have paid significantly more than I did for this game. Thanks for the memories Larian Studios. You have filled up and fortified my faith in video game developers. The film and television industry should be taking notes.",0.1

No shop aka micro-transactions. Looking forward to sinking in a few hundred more hours. Game deserves all the praise its received.,0.1
An amazing game that actually took the time to make the world feel expansive and lived in. The first act stands on its own two feet with barely a hint of anything from prior Baldur's Gate Titles. Every character has a great story to experience and each one is worth getting invested in. This game was a labor of love and you can feel that with conversation. Decisions have weight and you'll find yourself playing multiple times to find out what happens down the path you didn't take. In one of the most competitive years for GOTY this one stands above the rest.,0.1

Great launch, amazing voice acting, superb storytelling, character development, world building, no micro-transactions shoved down your throat and just a company that overall cares and listens to its customers. Larian took their time and created a masterpiece unlike other companies who release half-baked products. This game takes me back to my childhood when I used to play NeverWinter Nights. This has easily become one of my favourite games. Hats off to you Larian, you guys have really outdone yourselves and you truly deserve to win GOTY!",0.1

I tried once in high school and got frustrated in the first room not knowing what I was supposed to do and never tried again.  I saw the bear scene on Tik Tok and had to get this game.  I'm obsessed.  I'm over 100 hours in with two characters and neither is even remotely close to beating it.  There is just so much to do, so many options, so many ways the story could unfold, so many amazing characters and beautiful sets.  It doesn't feel repetitive even when I'm doing the exact same quest again because I'm doing it a different way.  After the massive disappointment of Diablo 4 I definitely needed this.",0.1

"The experience of rolling dice in this work is excellent, not just a simple group running ceremony, but perfectly presents this unique game behavior in the form of video games, this sense of participation, mystery and uncertainty , all built in the vast and fascinating world of Baldur's Gate 3. Larian used their persistence to tell us once again that CRPG is still charming, and what is the true depth and fun of emergent interaction. In my opinion, the massive content and mature design techniques are not the most prominent features of this work. The greatness of CRPG lies in the accumulation and gradual changes step by step, the more ingenious network narrative, and the fighting fun that only increases and does not decrease. It is difficult to guess the development of the world, what kind of identity to participate in, and what kind of world belongs to you, this is what our ideal fantasy world looks like.",0.1

"I’ve been gaming for over 20 years and I’ve never left a review before, but BG3 is such a once in a generation masterpiece that I felt compelled to add to the chorus of praise. The scope is mind-blowing - each act is massive yet has a distinct feel and after nearly 100hrs I never got bored of exploring. The combat is intricate and there are so many ways to approach situations - I didn’t think I would spend so much time considering positioning and trying to get an advantage over enemies and trying new tactics just to see what would happen, as opposed to simply spamming the same spells and actions every encounter. Each encounter was just different enough for what came before to feel fresh. The multitude of stories are engaging and it’s impressive how many permutations there are for some threads. I often went back to previous saves to make a different choice so I could see how to affects subsequent encounters. There’s a boss battle in act 2 that plays out so differently based on some choices you make in the lead up. I can’t wait to play the game again with a different character and party and approach, and see how the story warps around a different set of decisions. This is really a masterclass in video games.",0.1

Games like this and Diablo 4 are great reasons to pirate before you buy it or wait for it to go on sale for $10 once the patch's fixed it.",0.06

"After around 90 hours playing and completing all three acts, I have a few observations. Act 1 equals Act 2 and 3 combined in length, with Act 2 being the shortest but strongest due to introducing the main antagonists. However, a major issue I have is the lack of proper setup for these main villains. The writing is inconsistent, resulting in some scenes being engaging while others fall flat. Each companion possesses unique traits, but these often negate each other's uniqueness, making none truly stand out.",0.05

This is the 1st Baldur's Gate game I've played and I am enjoying it very much. I didn't play D&amp;D growing up but now that I'm in my 40's my interest in RPG's and table top games has grown. This game is a great introduction into the world. Storytelling is top notch and the sense of adventure and endless possibilities is unmatched.,0.1

"It was a fantastic game until the end of moonrise towers. Afterwards arriving in the city it went completely of the rails. I didn't understand the discussion about woke content on steam until i arrived in the city. The first three experiences after arriving were over the top woke, seemed rather like a parody but i doubt any company dares parody these days concerning woke stuff. Afterwards, exploring the city i somehow killed the habitants of about every second house. You saving the city seems worse than any damage, the problem you are trying to avert could cause. Having a choice the people of Baldurs Gate probably would probably happily take another covid shot if that keeps maniacs like you from trying to save them.",0.04

"Baldur's Gate 3 is not a bad game. I would in fact say it's a good game, however in the genre that it exists in, Isometric RPG, it's about average. I think what's happening is that a lot of new players, who have no idea what an Isometric RPG is, are suddenly playing the ""cool game"" and enjoying it. A lot of the additional mechanics, such as shove, are just out of place and contrite. The story is lacking and seriously underwhelming. At times you wonder if you're advancing it at all. In the end come for the novelty, but go play Baldur's Gate I&amp;II for great games!",0.07

I'm only 30ish hours in to the official release but as someone who played it for about 15-20 hours in early access over 2 years ago they have really put the work into this game. For those who are having a bit of trouble with the complicated UI just know its D&amp;D 5e accurate and the streamlined it more than I thought possible. The fact they were able to covert all this alone is incredible.,0.1

"Um dos melhores RPGs lançados nos últimos anos, como um fã dos Baldurs gate anteriores, da série divinity, e do dungeons and dragons, eu não poderia ficar mais satisfeito com o resultado deste título. Mesmo tendo uma criação de personagem simples, que por sua vez não é um ponto negativo, sua gameplay e história tornam a experiência de joga-lo excelente. Um dos poucos títulos onde suas escolhas realmente trazem consequências para a trama, com personagens bem escritos e cativantes. Este jogo é garantia de horas de diversão, com fator replay muito elevado, onde com cada personagem seu você pode ter uma experiência diferente.",0.1
"A captivating story, amazing voice acting, a rich and detailed world where missing a small detail could see you skipping more story than some games have within their entirety. I have been playing for 40 hours and still only feel like I've just scratched the surface. I haven't enjoyed a game this much since Knights of the Old Republic when I was a small child. I can't get enough of it. I'm already planning what I'll do on my second playthrough. Believe the hype. This game gives you more freedom than any other game I've experienced, barring Tabletop games, and this comes pretty damn close to even that in terms of player freedom.",0.1
"After years of waiting, Baldur's Gate 3 is finally here, and it's amazing in every way. It feels like playing Dragon Age: Origins back in the day – both are amazing games. I don't have anything bad to say about this game apart from one feature ı liked in the first 2 games there was a mechanic where if you put two companions that don't like each other together, they would eventually fight and kill each other. Other than that, the story, gameplay, characters, sidequests, world, and combat – everything is amazing.",0.1

"Very high quality art design and visual style, but that was the only good thing about the game for me. Sludgy character movement with very awkward and frustrating camera behaviour, e.g. clicking on invisible foreground terrain geometry sends you running backwards. Combat with your humanoid party is like trying to position giant battleships made of glass. But worst of all is the constant sexual overtures from NPCs - it's like Me Too never happened.",0.02

"I haven't played the original Baldur's Gate series, so I can't judge this game from this perspective, but I played Divinity (and completed it as well), so I can probably say if it is a good game or not, and the short answer is yes. This game is a huge step forward compared to previous Larian games in terms of cinematic quality, story telling, and the plot itself. But let's dive into the review and speak in detail about all aspects of the game. First character creation (yeah, many people talk about it, but I also want to say my small part). Character creation in this game is not about a huge amount of sliders to create a detailed version of yourself or some celebrity (yeah, the boobs slider is missing), but this game is about picking the right class that will fit your race and also ability scores and backgrounds to create your own imbalanced hero of the DND world. That will also affect the variants of dialogs that will be available or not and, as a result, open or close possible ways to complete the whole game. Also, companionship is another important moment that can change as your playstyle and story change because each of them has their own class, race, background, and so on. As a result, even at the start ****, there can be many layers of complexity that can intimidate players (or not, if you're kind of lazy). Plot branching is another key aspect that can be enjoyed by casual good-story lovers. You can be a bad guy who just wants to get some money or a hero who can save the world (or destroy it because it's funny). Additional features that can increase immersion are good cinematics with excellent graphics, and all of the dialogs are voiced. The gameplay part is similar to previous games (Divinity), except that all your actions need a dice drop. D20? D6? D4? You take all of them. In all other aspects, gameplay is based on the character that you created and used. Yes, it can be simple RMB clicks on enemies or various combinations of spells used to defeat them. The sound part is also a great part of the game; the music is well suited to actions on the screen, and the final musical theme also has good sound. In the final part, let's talk about some issues or bugs that I noticed during my playthrough. Minor visual artifacts in cutscenes closer to the final part of the game are OK; just compare it to the first half that does not contain bugs (thanks to early access) so that problem will be fixed. Another bug is more complicated and related to enemy AI that cun stuck and during the combat just stand and dont do any actions yeah its ok and make battles more easily but it increase time as well because game try to make enemy attack but them desagree with game and just stand and take our time. The last part is kind of strange: there is a moment in the game (trying to tell it without spoilers) where you can refuse the help of a character and say that you're going to do it in another way, and your companion can say that you use an item to rescue another character (and what strange things she can say even if you don't have this item), so in case you don't have the required item, you can get stuck in a location because you don't have it and refuse the offer of another charter, so the one solution is to reload the previous save. So to whom will I recommend this game? Probably to everyone who is not scared of turn-based combat and wants a very well-crafted story with various ways to be told.",0.1
one of the best RPGs/game I've played in my life. this is what an AAA game should be. so many games these last ~5 years have been major disappointments with few exceptions (looking at you elden ring) its a breath of fresh air. really knocked this one out of the park,0.1

I have played this game for 146 hours at the times of this review and I have barely scratched the surface of the game, although it is true that I have deleted some of my characters with much time invested because I changed my mind about their looks. Still tho, I have played enough to understand it's quality, it is incredibly good, I wouldn't say perfect but certainly close to a perfect CRPG. I played Divinity Original Sin 2 for many MANY hours, it is quite similar to Baldur's Gate 3, but every character has been massively improved in this game. Certainly a GOTY",0.1

"Um dos melhores jogos de todos os tempos sem duvidas, a quantidade de coisas para fazer e absurda, e tudo o que voce faz tem um impacto significativo na aventura, mas o impressionante não e apenas a quantidade e sim a qualidade deste vasto mundo, as missões são incriveis, chega de missões toscas do tipo ""leve uma pedra do ponto A até o B"", as missões do jogo são iradas como TODOS os games DEVERIAM SER",0.1
Melhor RPG que já joguei na minha vida. Parabéns para a Larian Studio por me proporcionar muitas horas de imersão narrativa.,0.1
"Sem dúvidas um dos melhores RPG's que joguei nos últimos tempos, marcando história, mesmo o fato do jogo ser por turnos, não foi o suficiente para afastar as pessoas, já que da para sentir o carinho, cuidado e dedicação de cada um dos criadores. Esse jogo deveria ser um exemplo para as grandes desenvolvedoras e principalmente devs os quais julgam por motivos fúteis. Que esse jogo seja visto como desafio a ser quebrado para quem ainda ama games e inspire estes mesmos a fazer seus jogos com muito amor e carinho, como eu senti neste jogo e como faz anos que não sentimos em jogo algum.

"Dialogue options really change the world, and the endings. Your race, class, sub-class, and history heavily alter the choices you are given during gameplay. The difficulty is above average even on easy difficulty, but as it is possible to roll back the save, it doesn't have that much of a problem.

"BG3 is the best electronic rpg of all time, it makes Zelda look like an old car all torn apart and broken.  The beauty of BG3 is sublime on all levels, the criticisms here are mostly untrue and without any sense of fanaticism as if the game or platform were religion.  The only criticism I have about BG3, is that the camera system could have been improved on viewing angle and way of tracking.",0.1

"The best Game of the year. Mecanics, story, everything is fantastic in this game.",0.1
"One of the most thoughtful games I've ever played. Every combat encounter is different and creativity is rewarded! I've played 30+ hours since it released and cannot wait to play more. Having played nearly every RPG made in the past twenty years, I can easily say this is the best by far (followed by Witcher 3, Mass Effect (1-3), NWN 1 and BG 1.

The detailed and mysterious world of Faerûn, deep character customization, and rules system based on D&amp;D 5e provide an authentic experience. Strategic and exciting combat, along with an immersive narrative and memorable characters, make this game a gem for RPG lovers. Every decision counts and the relationships with the characters add extra emotional value. Baldur's Gate 3 is an adventure that immerses you in an epic world and awakens the desire for more.

"A Larien Studios fez um trabalho fenomenal. Cenários absurdamente detalhados, NPCs vivos de verdade (literalmente cada um tem um nome, uma história, uma vocação, uma profissão), questlines muito bem elaboradas, muitas, muitas, mas muitas opções de diálogos e formas de resolver as coisas. Tudo isso por um preço bem mais barato do que a maioria dos grandes jogos desse ano. Espero muito que seja o GOTY em 2023.",0.1

"I really admire games coming from Larian Studio. Divinity 2 has made a golden standard for cRPG to me. This game with all its mechanics, different approaches to every encounter, the conversations and questline was just perfect. Obviously there were some minor issues on the way, but nothing gamebreaking. I feel same but even better for Baldur's Gate 3. It is awesome game with great and polished mechanics and a really good storyline. I am over 80 hours into it in just 11 days of gameplay and I am loving every part of this game. Strong recommendation and a GOLDEN STANDARD for any future game coming from any greedy and complaining studio.",0.1

"Sem dúvidas alguma uma obra de arte, como os desenvolvedores de outras empresas então falando, uma anomalia da indústria. O jogo entrega tudo que promete, um combate complexo e com inúmeras possibilidades, nunca um combate será igual a outro, cada dialogo é interessante, onde existe várias possibilidades de resolver um problema e isso sem dúvidas é o que mais que surpreende, você literalmente pode interpretar o que o seu personagem faria, assim como em uma mesa de D&amp;D. Óbvio que existe alguns bugs ou outras coisas que podem não agradar, mas qualquer uma delas é ofuscada pelos pontos positivos, ver o carinho que essa empresa teve e o quanto apostaram em um gênero de combate esquecido, é simplesmente incrível. Esse jogo sem dúvidas merece ainda mais reconhecimento do que tem, sendo pra mim um dos melhores de todos os tempos.",0.1

If you love Dragon Age Origins and Old School Bioware games, this is the game for you. There is so much content and not only that but the replayability is there when you want to play as the Dark urge, an evil/good character, or even the Origin characters.",0.1

Jogo RPG já faz 20 anos e não tem como negar o nível que a Larian Studios chegou de maestria em Baldur's Gate 3 beira a perfeição. Uma história cativante com personagens cativantes que faz querer conhecer a fundo tudo que pode acontecer e explorar cada cantinho de Faerun que parece ter saído diretamente da nossa imaginação. De uma chance a essa maravilha e não se arrependa.,0.1
"Perfect adaptation of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons tabletop roleplaying game. For those who love to play D&amp;D 5e this is a must! And for those who aren't familiar with the mechanics of the game style: yes it is slow combat with many cutscenes throughout the entire game with a lot of focus on the roleplay of the characters, each decision you make can and will have an impact on the whole game. This is EXACTLY what happens in the D&amp;D 5e tabletop game. 10/10 for the incredible adaptation. Hatters gonna hate, but just ignore them and have a wonderful time playing",0.1
"Eu não curtia jogos de turno, porem esse jogo furou muito a bolha, , a Larian realmente fez uma obra de arte aqui, joguei o Early acess e adorei a experiencia, tanto que joguei e zerei Divinity Original Sin 2 feito pela mesma produtora (Larian Studios), não tinha muita experança quanto ao lançamento de Baldur's Gate III, pois o early acess já estava bom e não chava que podia melhorar muito, agora estou simplesmente MUITO viciado no jogo, vou trabalhar e só penso em chegar em casa continuar minha aventura com meu Warlock. 10/10 GOTY",0.1

It's one of those games that we keep talking about as a group even when not playing it.

It's better than almost every single game ever made and it probably will stay that way for a while. The attention to detail during making this game was so big you can complete the game 12 times and can get new cutscenes every single time. Game is amazing but there's a lot of bugs. The amount of bugs is so big that the rating has to suffer by at least 1 point if not more.,0.09

A genuine breath of fresh air in the gaming space today. I have very minor gripes with some QOL things. But the game itself is phenomenal. The sheer scope of the game is massive and is oozing with replayability. If you've ever been on the fence for trying DnD and haven't.. give this one a try. You will probably find yourself dying to play it afterward. I also recommend playing solo before playing with a group as it is a vastly different experience (for good reasons),0.1

This game is practically perfect in every way.  There have been a few minor bugs but nothing to break me out of the immersion that this game offers.  Every conversation is handled extremely well and the outcomes are so fun to watch unfold.  A game where your decisions matter.  The combat is tactical turn based and is so fun solo or with friends offering a wide variety to combat encounters.   I haven’t had this much fun since Dragon Age Origins.  PS: Do not listen to the negative reviews.  They are all junk ;),0.1

First game of this genre I have played for some 20 years. I am so glad i picked this up. It runs well on my aged pc with a 1080 card and I have suffered no graphical issues at all. The story drags you in very quickly and to me the game on normal is a fair challenge at first. The game is lovely to look at and quite indepth as it should be as a D&amp;D game. Plenty of things to read and lots to try to understand but that is I guess part of the charm.  I did not pre order or indeed buy it at release but watched some gameplay and thought why not try it. I am glad I did as I see no real hard faults in this game as of yet. Oh did I mention there is NO nasty microtransactions in this fine game,0.1

However after hearing about this game non-stop for the past week I decided to give it a shot ,and by the 9 hells and I glad I did.

If you are a fan of these types of games, this is a ""must-buy"" no question.

"Mass Effect Trilogy and the first Dragon Age were my favorite games for over a decade thanks to their well written and charming characters and enjoyable gameplay. Never thought I would get that sort of feeling from a game ever again honestly. Was running out of love and passion for the genre slowly but surely. With Baldur's Gate 3. Not only did it reignite my passion but it became my favorite game of all time. The story, THE CHARACTERS like Karlach my beloved Tiefling sweetheart, Shadowheart, ASTARION MY BRO.

"The long awaited Spiritual successor to bioware in its prime. Have spent time with this title since early access and watched this game transform from a early access bugfest to a masterpiece **** that has renewed my love of modern RPG's. A game that rewards and incentivices creativity while offering significant player agency, and satisfying choice where once can be equal parts hero, villain or something in between. The character writing, romance, combat, attention to detail, and humor are some of the best i have ever seen in an RPG. Simply put this is a MUST PLAY for RPG lovers alike, and while there are small technical issues at time Larian has proven they are very fast to patch things and fix bugs so i will not let those small things affect my score. An all time great game that will be remembered for many many years",0.1

I never played DnD myself, but i liked to watch other people to play some p&amp;p. At the beginning the DnD stuff was a bit overwhelming. But now i've played this game for about 40 hours, and i love it! I'm still in act 1, because there is soo much stuff to do. I can't rate this game less than 10/10.",0.1

"Unfortunately, is not common to see a game release with so much good content as this. That SHOULD be the standard!

Sets up new standards. Reminds of old Bioware games. Not finished the game yet but so far it's fantastic.,0.1
"Having finished the game I was absolutely enthralled the entire time. I never typically feel the need to 100% games and don't regret not doing it as if I am truely interested in the game I will watch videos of different endings and whatnot, but this game is different i focused only on my companions stories i had with me in combat, and i actually regret it as after the ending i want to see what its like getting everything done and getting the perfect ending where i complete all stories and go the good route. I will likely play through the game and go slower the next time which is a unique thing for me to do. I hope that everyone can give this game a try. It was so good i was almost a little depressed when i finished as i wish i could play for another 60hrs. I will have to attempt to play again and complete it fully... As perfectly as i can.",0.1
Larian Studios has really out done themselves this time. And I dare say this is the best game that has been released for the past 20 years by any studio and I highly doubt that there will be any other game that will be this good for the next 20 years.

"I've been a big fan of Larian studios ever since Divinity: dragon commander. They've outdone themselves with the divinity: original sin series but this game just launched them to stratospheric levels. There are bugs here and there, but it's almost negligible considering the game's insane scope. This game is all that is good in original sin, but none of its shortcomings. Truly one of the best games of the decade, it's way up there to the likes of Zelda: tears of the kingdom.",0.1
This is my first time reviewing a game and I actually created this account just to review this one.  Baldur's Gate 3 has restored my faith in at least 1 company that is creating games still.  To play a game that you can feel the passion that went into development is rare and welcoming.  10/10 recomend buying and supporting the team that created such a masterpiece ,0.1

"Baldur's Gate 3 é uma experiência de RPG incrivelmente envolvente que captura a essência do mundo de Dungeons &amp; Dragons de maneira excepcional. Com uma narrativa rica e ramificada, o jogo oferece escolhas significativas que influenciam o curso da história e os destinos dos personagens. Os gráficos impressionantes e a atenção aos detalhes criam um mundo cativante, repleto de locais icônicos e desafiadores. A adaptação do sistema de regras de D&amp;D 5ª Edição é realizada de forma elegante, permitindo uma jogabilidade estratégica e tática repleta de opções mágicas e de combate. A interação com NPCs, os diálogos complexos e as múltiplas soluções para problemas adicionam uma profundidade única à exploração. Embora em acesso antecipado, Baldur's Gate 3 já promete ser uma adição memorável à série, agradando tanto aos fãs antigos quanto aos novos, com seu equilíbrio entre a nostalgia e a inovação",0.1

"The best game ever made, tops Skyrim and Dragon Age Origins which held the title for me. The game is perfect to the minute details. It really doesn't happen much anymore that games are so good and the devs so passionate about it, it really feels good to be able to experience such an immersive world again. At the same time it's sad that the devs from big studios are bashing it and saying it's setting an unrealistic standard - Larian is not as big of a studio and they managed to create such a great game, if these studios did put some heart in games instead of milking people with microtransactions and shallow, copy-paste games they wouldn't be unrealistic. I really hope that there will be more games made with passion thanks to Larian and BG3 success. Until then I will keep playing Baldur's Gate 3 hoping it will never end, but when it does I will surely be replaying it.",0.1

Not many bugs (I found at most one line of dialogue that was not translated and I had to close and open the game to be able to open the forge, other than that), amazing exploration, beautiful graphics (beautiful ShadowHeart), millions of dialogue options , combat even being turn-based is very complex and dynamic.

The best part I'm not even done with the story at all it's wild my wish of a banger of a dnd game is sated I got it, it's everything I ever wanted, 10/10 I'm definitely hooked while the turn based play isn't for everyone you can tell the dev took the time to hone the game and craft it into a labor of love for dnd fans and gamers alike!!",0.1

But its a 10 due to how much I am enjoying my first playthrough and I’m almost at the end. Going to start another playthrough immediately after.",0.1

Now after so long BG3 has once again put me in the same happy place as old Bioware and CDProjektRED. Much love to Larian for making this game possible and I hope the next cyberpunk, witcher and the next mass effect learn from this game.",0.1

"The best new game I've played in years.  I'm not even that fond of turn based combat, but the combat manages to be fun for the most part.  What is really special about BG3 are the story and characters.  I get classic Bioware vibes while talking to these companions and finding out more about their past.  They feel like real people.  The story is full of twists and turns and can be progressed in so many different ways.  The amount of choices in this game is staggering.  What makes it even more special is that those choices have long lasting consequences that you might not feel until 40 hours later.  All of these things and BG3 still has a level of polish that puts most AAA studios to shame.  It might not be, but this SHOULD be the new standard for RPGs.",0.1

Not to much hand holding and the possibility to mess up(a very fun part of dnd). I highly recommend this game to everyone, even those that are not into RPG for the RP reason.

"GOTY contender FOR SURE!! Baldur's Gate 3 is THE NEW STANDARD for ALL game developers and publishers going forward WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT. NO gamer is going to expect Baldur's Gate 3 level of games from any Indie developer, but we WILL be EXPECTING it from all of the big budget triple A developers like EA, Ubisoft, Microsoft, Sony, Blizzard and others FROM NOW ON. Because Baldur's Gate 3 has once again PROVEN that great games CAN be made WITHOUT microtransactions, WITHOUT massive day one patches, WITHOUT horrific glitches, bugs and being an unfinished mess. So other developers now have ZERO excuses not to match BG3 in terms of game quality, gameplay and polish. Larian studios is now the industry STANDARD on how to make a good game and has proven that it's NOT impossible to make a good game and STILL remain within the $60 price tag. They have PROVEN all the other studios to be LIARS that just want to do less work, with less effort, for more money. As far as I'm concerned Larian games has my UTMOST CONFINDENCE AND TRUST with games. From now on when Larian comes out with a game, i dont even NEED to ask if they worked hard on it, for me it's ""shut up and take my money"".  I can't sing their praises enough on Baldur's Gate 3 and i hope the absolute BEST for them moving forward. And if BG3 wasn't enough, Swen Vincke went and turned down Microsoft on their offer to buy Larian games.

The game is dark yet whimsical with nuanced characters from villains to companions to random NPCs. Even the animals in this game are entertaining. Although some aspects fall a bit flat such as Act 3 and a particular companion quest, the game itself outshines these flaws making them barely noticeable. 10/10.",0.1

Grats for the best CRPG game of the year. More just the one year. 100 hours and this is not even limit.,0.1
"This game was not hyped in my friend circles, even though they have played DnD for quite a while. I'm bad at DnD and don't enjoy the DnD combat style. That's why Baldurs Gate 3 has been an absolute slam dunk for me. This feels like an insane breath of fresh air compared to even Elden Ring, which is another game I love to death. I did not expect to be a fan of the turn-based ""top-down"" combat style but I've become addicted to it. The ONE thing that should be considered as a bias is that I play this game with a group. I cannot say if this game would be as fun alone unless I was a hardcore fan of the combat, which I might be by the end of our run. I have clocked 20 hours into the game and haven't even completed Act 1, and I have heard that act two and three are both longer than act one. I am extremely excited to continue playing Baldurs Gate 3 and hope that Larian are able to take home GOTY with this modern sleeper hit.",0.1
Amazing game with amazing graphics and story. I can't wait for my second and third playthrough.,0.1

Cant imagine that a CRPG helps me back to the game world after deep disappointed by Final Fantasy XVI.,0.1
"This game, which I didn't expect, made me love dungeon and dragon-style RPGs. I take immense pleasure in playing it. I own up to my mistakes and choices, and I find it really enjoyable to have a game where sometimes the 'hero' is not perfect and can't save everyone. I also enjoyed searching for answers about the Dungeons and Dragons rules. One might think that stepping out of the game to understand everything would be negative, but in reality, the game is so exciting that you want to uncover its secrets. I definitely endorse this game to all role-playing game fans (I speak french)",0.1

"Awesome seeing Larian knock it out of the park, sure there are some system snags and snafus but this really elevated the groundwork laid by the Divinity series. No MTX, a mind boggling amount of content, a big middle finger to the AAA studios that are churning out garbage. Love seeing the bitter responses from people who create and make excuses for lackluster play experiences. This is what gaming can be, and ought to be. I'll give you more money by gifting a couple copies you Golden Gods!!!",0.1

"played the early access maybe a year or so ago and it filled me with excitement for the full game, what they had in it already felt more then enough to justify the price tag, but then the game blows away my expectations on full release, I've never felt more engaged in a game, the story alone is amazing, and on top they have tons of features full polished and in depth. 10/10 I don't think I've played a better game, i only fear I won't be able to play something similar for a very long time.  game of the year for sure. game in the decade I wouldn't be surprised.",0.1

As a young teenager in the late 90s I would get wrapped up in the fantasy worlds of video games and how they seemed to be built for players to truly escape into and enjoy.

I played Early Access for quite some time and am so happy for the Larian Team's success. If you love roleplay games of any kind, both digital and tabletop, BG3 is a MUST have. Even if this is the last game Larian makes, they have already cemented themselves as one of, if not the best CRPG makers in gaming history. With that being said I look forward to any new projects they make.",0.1

It's just so refreshing and nice to know that there are game devs that just want to make games and release them in their entirety without having to milk the fans or have parts of the game locked behind a paywall - there is love in this and it  shows - the game is perfect - don't really care for the bugs cause look at what we got compared to 99% of most games,0.1
Simplesmente o melhor RPG que eu já joguei na minha vida a Larian studios esta de parabéns pelo excelente trabalho,0.1
"Best Game in Years.  Proves games don't have to be shooters or action games.  Gorgeous, challenging if you want it that way and also has puzzles.  Larian put a lot of time and money into it and it shows.  EA has a lot to live up to with Dragon Age 4 next year.  I mention this as they are of the same genre.",0.1

Divinity Gate 3. Not Baldur's Gate. Sound is not as nice as the original. Turned based is too slow. Camera mechanics are clunky. Cinematic zoom-ins are obnoxious. Please zoom out and not show me hideous CGI closeups. Speedrun the game with wizard in 10 minutes with gale and feather fall.,0.0

And to all the ""this is a slow combat game"" ... you are stupid. I loved BG1+2, but missing turn based was a weakness of BG1+2 and a strength in games like Pathfinder after they introduced it. It's DnD, not your daily kiddy clicker game.",0.1
"I have not experienced such emotions probably since I had been playing the Witcher 3. The game is very fascinating, you want to understand it, it throws up unexpected moments and immerses you in yourself, you want to associate yourself with your hero and you experience the events in the game as your own, especially knowing that the further outcome depends on your actions.

"I played this game for years in early access, and while I had a great time, I had resigned it to one of those games that was just far too ambitious of a project to ever see completion. But boy, was I wrong. While the graphics aren’t anything particularly impressive, the storylines are some of the most creative, well-thought and enticing of any game I have ever played. The combat mechanics, as well as the roleplay mechanics, are intricate, but somehow also easy to learn as you level up. The characters are flawed and likeable, while the puzzles leave you with a satisfaction that other games lack. I made an account on ketacritic to say this: this is as close to perfect a game as I have ever played.",0.1

"Larian has done in Baldur's Gate what every DM across the world dreams of: the world they have conjured and the game that plays across it is meticulous in detail, sparing no expense for terrain, traps or interaction. Early in the game you get a rich feeling of power from all of the different classes who tackle obstacles with their own diverse talents (or employ magic to bridge the gaps), offering some of the most intense and creative avenues for completion. On top of all that, and most importantly, the game is FUN! Loot is plentiful and interesting, the characters are delightfully charming, and the execution of animations is a joy to look at.

I would even strongly recommend it for someone who‘s not even interested in DnD as this is such a good game!,0.1

The game has an insane amount of content from dialogues to hidden areas and unique interactions depending on race, class play history and certain spells. It is everything a game should be and worth buying at full price.

"I've been playing video games for 25 years since I got my snes with 6 years. I am a typical passionate gamer that plays almost every genre of single player games, but my biggest love were always crpgs. It blowed my mind as I played dragon age origins for the first time as it's release. It was my first crpg and I never expirienced the amount of freedom in choosing between so many skills and builds. The story was amaizing and the companions were extremely well written. I also love pillars of eternity and pathfinder games and especially divinity original sin 2 (what is one of my favourites game of all time), but I always missed the intriguing cut scenes and the full voice over. Baldurs Gate 3 is the combination of the deep tactical combat and great world building of divinity original sin 2 with the great and immersive cut scenes and a extremly intriguing story of dragon age origins combined with a stupendous amount of content. But what blows my mind is the amount of detail in every single side mission, side character, little details in the world in regard to the amount of content. This game is so good that I made a metacritic account and wrote my first game critique only to praise this game. My hype was huge after divinity series and the great early acces but they managed to excel my expectations. I played a lot of games the last 25 years in my life but this is the goat with a wide margin for me. Well done larian, every single game from you in the future is an autobuy for me. This studio and fromsoftware are the kings of rpgs and game developement that shows the middlefinger to every soulless copy and paste game from ubisoft, ea, etc. I hope the studio will continue there course and will give us a lot of fantastic experiences in the future !",0.1

"While she very minor bug issues, none have been game breaking. This had been one of the best, most polished, game I've played in a long time. More studios should arrive for this quality.",0.1
"Well, where to begin. BG3 has ruined gaming for me as 95% of games in my Steam library feel incredibly sub-par and lack the effort required to create an immersive experience that compares to BG3. Gaming is escapism from the real world and Larian have crafted a near perfect game (inventory management is a mess). I do not need to expand on my reasons why I feel this way as all the reviews both critical and user speak for themselves. Those who are giving BG3 bad feedback have not taken the time to learn the mechanics and want an 'on rails' experience like COD. If storytelling and vast adventure is your thing, buy BG3. Take your time learning the spells and abilities you have and enjoy a rare release in gaming history.",0.1

"A well written and well implemented RPG based on the Dungeons and Dragons ""Forgotten Realms"" setting. A must have for all the fans of D&amp;D, fantasy genre, good storytelling or even fans of tactical combat. It merges the best elements of the original Baldur's Gate/Neverwinter Nights games, the tactics of XCOM, the storytelling of Torment, the complex nuances of fighting of Pillars of Eternity, and of course the advanced and deep map design of Divinity Original Sin. Well done to the developers at Larian!",0.1

"Great RPG game, made me feel the same level of excitement as in my childhood with fresh mind 25 years ago when playing 1 and 2 parts. I love deep development of roleplaying aspects, good amounts of lore, some small and touching references to the first two games. Interesting story, great cinematic dialogues and voice acting. As a 5e TTRPG fan glad to see pretty close adaptation of the ruleset in such a massive and well designed computer RPG. Love Larian approach to companions with rich development, interactions and the story for each one. The game world is carefully and passionately filled with tons of small details that create deep feeling of immersion. The game is very hard to pull from, spending night hours and hours playing. Great job Larian, was well worth waiting so many years to get this gem and travel the Forgotten Realms once again!",0.1

"I can't put this game down! God-tier game. At first, I wasn't sure about the whole turn base thing coming from an ARPG, but after a few hours everything changes, a light switch clicked ""Duh, this is like sitting around with your friends playing D&amp;D in real life"". On top of that, you feel so immersed in the game because you don't have any microtransaction currency to remind you that if you buy this or that the amount going to equal your baby's weekly diaper expense.",0.1

"Larian studious provided us with a game that built atop the foundations laid by great RPGs before it like: Dragon Age Origins, POE 1 &amp; 2, Torment and Kotor. The sandbox they built, and the limitless gameplay is unlike anything we've ever gotten. No Microtransactions, No DLC, Complete and FULL game Apon release. Larian Studio knows it audience and corresponded and provided us with one of the best RPGs of all time.",0.1

"An excellent follow-up to its decades-old predecessor, Baldur's Gate III sets a new gold standard for RPGs in the modern age. Though it has its fair share of buggy problems, the vibrant world, intriguing storytelling, and captivating gameplay more than make up for its shortcomings.",0.1
"Flawless story. So many different paths and aspects you can explore. Every new playthrough can unfold in many unpredictable ways. The plot is easy to understand, but challenging to master and predict, which makes the game capable of making you invest time and emotion.    Combat is strong and effective and memorable. Although lacking the momentum of action combat, the sounds moves and colors-animations flood the experience with energy, action and intensity.     The music is phenomenal and accurately picked for every situation. It follows and expands the DoS and DoS2 soundtracks, becoming richer and more impactful.     The game runs exceptionally well, but even so, Larian Studios released 2 or 3 hotfixes already in a few DAYS to fix small bugs. What studio releases hotfixes so rapidly for such a complex project?     You buy it, you play it. From start to finish. No ads, no microtransactions, no random promises for future story dlcs. Even if Larian Studios decide not to make a dlc, the story and gameplay mechanics are complete. This is how the games must be made. The respect to the customers and the pdoject itself is unquestionable.",0.1
Excellent game so far. The story telling is nice and I like the player choice in making decisions with the dialogs. The graphics is very good and the cut scenes look realistic.,0.1
"Probably my favorite game since Baldur’s gate 2. I’ve played quite a few cross and it ranks among the best, easily.",0.1

"I've been enjoying everyday when I play this game, 10 out of 10. The game delivered in a complete package with no micro transaction. This is what game supposed to be.",0.1
First game in a long time that has me this hooked. While i'm learning how things work they story and character interaction is great!  Challenging and i'm sure some bug arise but nothing game breaking so far.,0.1
This game has redefined what a gaming experience is. For too many years corporate greed has ruined the gaming industry and shackled the creators with unrealistic time crunches. This game just goes to show the love and attention a game developer and their team have when given the time and no corporate interference.,0.1

Larian has lived up to my every hope and expanded on my dreams. From character creation to credits, the depth of play is truly awesome. Every decision holds weight and consequence. The sheer range of adaptability allowed is mind boggling.   Time to create a second character...",0.1

I'm not someone who plays games of this genre very much, but I'm deep in it now and can tell I'm going to be playing this for a long time. It just scratches some exact itch for games that I didn't know was there.",0.1
"Very good game but very buggy in its current state. I had a lot of major questlines just break for me, especially in act 2. Not as bad so far in act 3 but jesus christ act 2 was a nightmare when it came to broken quests and questlines, and in a game like this that really hurts the experience. I would give it a 10/10 if it was bug free but the amount of the game that has been ruined for me brings it down to an 8/10.",0.08

I've never been hooked on a game in such a long time. I've already sunk 30+ hours into the game. I even stopped going to the gym regularly just so I could play. I'm new to this genre but I am enjoying it immensely. It feels like Diablo but it plays like Dragon Age. This is my first DnD based game and I can clearly see how much other games are referencing this game or have elements inspired by it. The lore is massive and I could barely keep up. There are things I don't understand but seems to make sense if you delve into the lore which means the game developers really know what they're doing,0.1

Soooo awesome!",0.1

After years of waiting for a new Mass Effect or Dragon Age like experience, Larian Studios was the one, bringing life to a world of gaming that cares about what gamers want, delivering us a game (no, an experience!) that deserves to be titled “Game of the Year”. I wish I could rate it more than 10. Well done Larian Studios!",0.1

This has exceeded every expectation I had for it since supporting it during it's very first days in early access. It has improved in nigh every region, and is an astounding achievement. I can only hope that other publishers and developers will follow Larian's example.",0.1

I love the fact that there are so many endings, so many different outcomes for decisions you make, whether in combat or in just regular conversation. It is definitely competing for a spot in my top 5 RPG's of all time. Also, I love the turn based combat, gives you time to plan your moves and make some silly outcomes happen!

I know I've only just scratched the surface with the 25+ hours put into this game.  Eagerly anticipated this years ago when I first played ealry access.  There is actually world changing impact hours after a quest decision was made.   So many different directions to go that I can already imagine replay being like a completely new character story arc.  I can't wait to see what else this game uncovers for me.  My hat is off to Larian Studios.  Congratulations on a real winner here.,0.1
"WOW.  To be honest, I hadn't even heard of Baldur's Gate and I was stuck in my own MMORPG life.  A friend highly recommended it and I decided to give it a go.  The storyline is AMAZING and there is so much depth to the characters.  This game is just pure enjoyment.  I've never played DND before and the mechanics took me a bit to learn.  You need to give it several hours to begin to comprehend the depth of the combat system.  But WOW - I'm amazed.  This is the best $70 (I bought the addon to support the devs) I have EVER spent.  Just blown away.  I'm so glad I gave it a try.  And, there aren't microtransactions..... welcome back to gaming how it should be!",0.1

This not even mentioning what seemed to me Act 3 cut content related to Karlach, The Iron Throne and the Gnomes in the foundary. Larian is know for this and they have made a sick game that is only 2/3s cooked. Until its fully cooked after a year I can only give it a subpar score.",0.03

I have already sunk 26 hours into this game over the weekend because I could not put it down. Stunningly immersive characters and settings, unique customization, hilarious encounters, romance options, and my favorite so far.. the weird goblin combat music. I don't know why, but it has been stuck in my head all day at work. Hate to see people review-bombing this because they included the option to have androgynous characters and gay romance options.

"This game is everything I hoped for and more! Not only does it feel like playing the next chapter in the Baldur's Gate series, but it also feels like a modern spiritual successor to Dragon Age: Origins. If you love Dungeons &amp; Dragons and/or RPGs then look no further. This is the kind of experience you only get once a decade in this genre. The attention to detail when it comes to the world, the characters, the voice acting, and the D&amp;D 5E ruleset is unreal. Larian Studios captured lightning in a bottle.",0.1

"It's been a long while since I really got into a game.Thats not to say I don't play a lot of games, because I do. But for some reason I tend to lose interest fairly quick. And I've never played a turn based RPG of any kind, I honestly don't even know what made me try this one, but thank the gaming gods I did. I bought baldurs gate 3 in early access about a week before it came out, and I can say with all certainty that it is by far the best game I have played in years. It's a game I am so excited to play every time I get home . BG3 has brought back the joy I used to get from playing games but haven't felt in far to long .  Just a truly great game .10/10",0.1
"I am more or less a hundred hours into the game and right now I'm in the middle of act 3. Even with a hundred of hours I feel like I’ve missed a lot of content, so I can’t wait to finish the game so that I can’t start over again. That’s the experience we are talking about, the game is so big that it’s impossible to really finish it in just one playthrough. It’s the first time in years that I feel like a video game it’s worth its price.",0.1
"Baldur's Gate 3 is the most great and ambitious CRPG ever. I had only played one CRPG, Disco Elysium, before playing Baldur's Gate 3, but since I learned in June that Baldur's Gate 3 was coming out and had an EA version, I immediately purchased the EA version after checking out the videos a little bit. Baldur's Gate 3 uses a combination of the original DnD5E rules and rules specific to Larian Studios to serve up a magnificent 3A run of facts. It is definitely the most 3A rated CRPG to date. I truly love it, before Starfield, this whole august is completely for BG3. And tips: everyone plays BG3 for the first time should play a single game to dive into the whole story, and multiplayer game is for another experience.",0.1
"One of the best RPGs ever made, on par with the Bioware of old. It takes the cRPG formula but moves it forward for a new audience, with plenty of choice and consequence. If you look at the story, character development, and gameplay mechanics (it uses the D&amp;D action system, not Divinity Original Sin's multiple action system), you will quickly realize that this is more than just ""Original Sin 3"" and love it for it.",0.1
"It's the most immersive experience I've had with an RPG in the last decade, every detail of the game breathes passion and care on the part of the developers, it's a game that marks an era and will forever be considered one of the pinnacle of its genre, it's not often that an RPG it's so good that makes the best RPGs on the market look mediocre.

"Game is simply amazing. After years of mediocre trash releases and so called ""games as a service""-disasters Larian really did it and released a complete and fun game, which takes the player serious and strives to deliver a great experience instead of boring stretched auto-generated content for monetization. I did encounter only one single bug in my 80+ hour playthrough of this giant game, which is basically unheard of nowadays. All in all we need to hold other game publishers responsible from now on to even reach 50 percent of this games polish in their future releases.",0.1

"Baldur's Gate III firmly establishes itself as one of the greatest PC games ever crafted. Seamlessly blending intricate narratives, rich character development, and vast, immersive worlds, the game stands as a pinnacle of the RPG genre. At its core, it pays a deeply respectful homage to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons ruleset, beautifully translating the tabletop mechanics to the digital realm. Players are gifted with an unparalleled freedom in choice and action, reminiscent of the most intricate D&amp;D campaigns curated by masterful Dungeon Masters. The game's ability to intertwine narrative depth with the complexities of D&amp;D gameplay mechanics not only satisfies long-time fans of the series but also introduces a new generation of players to the magic and wonder of this beloved universe. Through its impressive design, storytelling, and loyalty to its roots, ""Baldur's Gate III"" etches its name into the annals of gaming history.",0.1

Hats off to Larian, they gave a masterclass to every other developer on how to do a RPG.",0.1

"Baldur's Gate 3 feels like it took a detour through the Divinity realm. The game's craftsmanship is evident, but it's like expecting a dragon and getting a fairy - both magical, just different vibes. Some newer, 'woke' elements felt like seasoning I didn't order. While I appreciate innovation, it's not the kind I particularly cherish. I just missed that classic Baldur's Gate flavor.",0.0
"Perfect game , nobody but Larian could give that an excellent sequel for the baldur's gate series. I hope all the /phobia people and boomer will not lower the rating too much cause Larian deserve this , and i hope they'll have the goty !",0.1
"not fit for the Baldur's Gate title, it's a long X-COM mission with a dumb down interactions, flat characterisations and feels superficial and in consequence fails to deliver on world immersion and environmental clarity sprawling fantasy world ought to have. The genre surely needs improvements in graphics, UI, interactivity, etc... to feel current, but without overarching conception more appropriate for involved fantasy saga, it feels like rather empty technical exercise.",0.04

"I spent only 20 hours but I can say it's really engaging. It can be also challenging at times. Coming from DOS2, I feel at home but it's definitely a DnD and Baldur's Gate game. It's a very genuine RPG experience, beautifully crafted so far and I cannot wait to see more and more and more. I rated this a 9 initially but set it to 10 to compensate people who give this game a 0. You are allowed to dislike the genre the mechanichs but it can never be a 0, this game is clearly a work of love.",0.1

"A truly great game with almost unlimited possibilities, an amazing and interesting open worlds and great dialogues. If you want to lose yourself in a side quest that lasts up to 10 hours and the quest giver is a goat you can only talk to if you are an animal friend, that is the game for you. IMO that game is the new rpg-Standard and definitively GOTY.",0.1
An instant classic that will be recommended as a must-play title for all DnD and RPG enthusiasts,0.1
"First online review ever. Felt compelled to right the wrong of all the dishonest trolls giving it a zero. Does it really deserve a zero? No, it I’ve been around gaming since the 80’s and this is a great game and an excellent achievement by the developers. That it is a labor of love is obvious. Hopefully the new standard that gamers will demand from a declining industry. Now back to the game.",0.1
"This is one of the best video games I’ve ever played. I haven’t had an experience like this since Mass Effect 2. I’m normally not the type of person to replay games right after finishing them, but with this one I can’t wait to start again with a completely new character, with different choices, and a totally new story. Such an epic game. Highly recommend",0.1

Deep connections with interesting party members, a flushed out and motivating story line, a loyal adaptation from D&amp;D, and flexibility to make my own choices and feel like they matter. I kinda obsessively played it for three days straight cuz I had the time before starting my new job. To say I love this game is an understatement.",0.1

"As someone who plays D&amp;D I can appreciate the Devs for trying(with great success I might add) at transposing the feeling and mechanics of it into a video game. I love it ENTIRELY, from the setting to the characters, to the different ways of solving a problem. I haven't even gotten to Baldur's Gate yet but from what I've seen so far I am genuinely impressed. This game really scratches a D&amp;D fan's itch when it comes to PC gaming not to mention you can feel the dedication and love the Devs poured into it.  For all the ""haters"" out there that complain that it's ""boring"" I would like for you to play an actual D&amp;D game with at least 4 other people to see how ""fast-paced"" a session really is.",0.1
"Everything is perfect, everything in the game is like a spider web. Whether it's the enormity of the missions, the way the graphics reflect that world or the way every single detail has sound. The game is like a joke, I'm sure I won't see something I did in my next experience. The way the world reacts to each choice is incredible compared to what other games have been doing lately. For example, the mood of your comrades continues not only for a certain period of time but until that incident is resolved, or the attitude of an NPC can become permanent as a result of the decisions you make, just like real life. Forget the games that have been sold as rpg until this time, this game is a real rpg and definitely the game of the year.",0.1

Cuantas más horas juegas y más avanzas (llevo unas 60) más te enamoras del juego y ves todo lo que tiene que ofrecer. La cantidad de posibilidades abruma y cualquier decisión puede cambiar drásticamente como trascurre la historia. Es sin duda la mejor adaptación de un juego de rol a videojuego. Una obra maestra que va a marcar historia.,0.1
"Baldur's Gate 3 was highly recommended to me by several friends and I am so glad I did not miss out. BG3 is a masterclass showcase of the RPG genre and truly captures its essence. The rich storytelling combined with the incredible attention to detail immerses you in a world that is fantastic, in the truest sense of the word. The character and sound designs are amazing, the environment is beautiful, and the gameplay and story beats are engaging. Player choice feels meaningful and the game encourages you to interact and explore. Bravo to Larian Studios for delivering such a well-executed and refined experience. Larian is a refreshing and welcome outlier amongst AAA game developers in 2023. They are a bright beacon contrasting against the gloomy sea of slapdash cashgrabs, whose developers are so fixated on microtransactions and battle-passes that they neglect to create fun and fulfilling games. I am excited by the high bar set by Larian Studios with Baldur’s Gate 3 and optimistic it will continue to raise industry standards in the AAA space.",0.1

"Ubisoft, EA, and Activision should shove their micro ""P"" and let the people talk about how really great this game is and how hardworking Larian studio is, and how happy it makes us her consumers feel, first of all, no micro-transaction a pricy game like everything new on the market but you pay for what you get and here you get a great made RPG story-rich game with amazing RPG DnD like gameplay inspired turn-based ""Larian Style"" as we like and not like some other thrash on the market who afraid to lose their money because they make thrash and we are not people for them anymore we are just an easy bu$ck, not a people who enjoy the art, so please look to who you give your bu$ck, give it to someone who appreciates you and makes a great piece of art and not to someone who doesn't cares about giving you a great product and only want's to use you.",0.1

GOTY for me. I've played since day one of early access. This is absolutely a masterpiece courtesy of the devs at Larian Studios. I've put about 80 hours into my current playthrough and I still feel like I have a lot of time left. The story is amazing. The cutscenes are great. The dialogue can be cumbersome with some of the animations. If you're new to D&amp;D you have nothing to worry about. This game teaches you what you need to know for the purpose of the game. It's not overwhelming in my opinion. The combat is turn based but still very enjoyable.,0.1

"Whole bunch of hype with no substance. Sure the game is pretty, but when every single dialogue option goes to an in game cutscene even for npcs that say one line and don't have any interactions then it becomes overindulgent. The UI is absolutely terrible. It fights with you every step of the way and will have you constantly save scumming. The actual gameplay is not fun.

"Literally a 10/10 Game. Amazing gameplay, great lore, intriguing story and delightful characters. In an industry of rampant corporate greed, microtransactions, loot boxes, season passes and **** Larian Studios' Baldur's Gate 3 stands as a shining example of how great gaming could be and sets a new standard in the videogame industry.",0.1
"I have a total of 80hrs in BG3 30 of them were in very EA and 50 are post release. Some people are reviewing the game highly because of video game politics. I want to clarify that I am giving the game this score because it delivered on all of my expectations and introduced things in games I didn't think were technically possible. I work in software development and I can't imagine the boring technical work, all the database problems they had to solve for items and spells and stats. The fact that this launch went so smooth is wild, (though this was a PC only launch, far less to go wrong). As of writing this they have released 2 hotfixes, which I have not experienced any issues, but its good to see immediate response to things that have been found by others. As for story, its your own story. Its crazy to think about, but yes things are happening in this world and there is a plot. It feels like my own story though. I truly feel the things I do and the chances I take have full effect on the world around me. The gameplay is spot on D&amp;D. Which D&amp;D has been known for a great system, and at times can be min maxed and broken, but Larian didn't shy away from the cons, they accepted the positives and the negatives of the system and trust its players and lets them do what they want. So ya I don't care about what other game companies do and I don't care about sending a message. This is a damn good game. Its better than I expected. I have lost sleep, and played during work hours irresponsibly. I feel truly excited every time I start the game and I can't help but take notes for my next character.",0.1

"I haven't been this enthralled in a game since Breath of the Wild. Honestly, the amount of care, passion, and creativity that went into this game has me floored. This game has a great combat system from DOS2 and added so much immersion and even more DND inspiration. There are a few bugs here and there (with 3 hotfixes being provided in week 1), but for the sheer amount of content and immersion it can be overlooked. The auto-pathing can be frustrating at times too, but not enough to ruin the experience. Be prepared to spend hours upon hours on this game because of how fun and compelling the story is.",0.1

"A flawless return to the forgotten realms. I'm old enough to have played bg1 and 2 when they came out, and this game is such a rich comeback for this game series. Combat is turn based like real DND. The conversations and story rely on chance dice rolls which are addictively fun. There is so much detail, you could play this game 100 times and not see everything. With the races, classes and other character features there is almost limitless possibilities to try. Seriously this is a goty for me.",0.1

"The game is phenomenal and a masterpiece in RPGs where it sets a new, gold standard!  From the customization,  to the characters, classes, story and gameplay, there is something for everyone to enjoy even if you're brand new to the series. For new players, the game walks you through with excellent beginner-friendly tutorials, all of which can be toggled off for advanced players looking for a challenge!  Additionally, there isn't an ounce of transphobia or homophobia nor does it support anyone who uses their clout to go against transgender humans. Unlike JK Rowling, this game tells a riveting story that will keep you hooked based on the decisions you make. Buy it, play it, and see for yourself as to why this game is phenomenal and game of the year!",0.1
Easily the greatest CRPG of our Generation. Larian deserves all the praise they are getting for this incredible masterpiece.,0.1
"As someone who has always held RPGs dear to my heart since childhood, I can say that this has become the best RPG I have ever played. I don't know if it will with certainty remain my favorite, though it is now, but no matter what I feel confident saying that no game has ever done a better job of giving freedom and choice to characters in a way such as this. Combined with the mind boggling number of lines and cinematics, the world around you TRUELLY knows and reacts to every single one of your actions. Big and small.",0.1

The game is great! Devs have been updating non-stop on any issues that are reported. I think a lot of people who gave negative reviews don't understand what's at stake. What makes this game a 9-10 is not just the game but the fact it does not use explorative techniques to steal your money. You don't need to buy 20 DLCs to play the full game.  This is the standard we need to expect from every big title game. If not you will get Diablo Immortal where only the whales get to have fun.,0.1

Larian Studios knocked it out of the park again. Baldur's Gate 3 gives you boundless options from character customization and choices to make during your journey. It has a fantastic and immersive story. If you buy this game know that you are getting a full product from the start and not a broken product riddled with micro transactions designed to deprive you of as much of your money as possible while providing you with as little as possible. As far as I am concerned Baldur's Gate 3 is the gold standard for RPG games and furthermore serves as an indictment of the AAA game studios that consistently shovel out inferior quality games for exorbitant amounts of money.,0.1
"So i just finished 2nd Act of this game. It's not perfect, there was couple of bags, there is a few things that can be improved such as camera movement and sound. But i still give it a 10. That rating comes from my heart, cos i wanna show to Larian studios that we gamers appriciate their efforts. We love an full completed games without ingame shop, we love good script and characters. And we feel with what awe and diligence this game was made, for which we are incredibly grateful to the developers. This gratitude is expressed in support, both by a simple assessment and by the purchase of all possible editions of the game.",0.1

You are simply the gold of the gaming industry, I wish you and your management good luck because you are the ones who set the rhythm of the gaming industry.

Stellar graphics, varied and interesting companions, lots and lots of interesting things to do, find and discover.  I have waited a long time for a game like this, and I was worried they'd somehow wouldn't make D&amp;D justice, but boy did Larian deliver! It was worth the delay, the extended wait, the uncertainty.

This is a brilliant game. Possibly the best rpg I have ever played. Every single npc has a voice line. It’s possibly the grandest rpg I have ever played. This is my first dive into any game like this and I love it. I see a few of the negative reviews and they seem to be boomers stuck in the old times about how baldurs gate games were back 20 years ago. Times have changed for games and this game is way better than how they used to be as I tried them as a kid and they don’t come close to this.,0.1
"I don't play CRPGs, the turn based gameplay always seemed repetitive and boring to me. I can safely say that Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the best games I have ever played. After the prologue, it absorbs you into the D&amp;D universe and does not let you go, because you don't want it to. I would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat.",0.1
"Though constrained slightly by the DND system, BG3 manages to make a great experience in both single and multiplayer. A small peeve is that some of the dialogue with companions seems forced and unnatural, but it manages pretty well all things considered. There is a huge amount of content and even with nearly 100 hours I have not seen it all, so 9/10 for me.",0.09

The gameplay, story and characters are steller and the cinimatics and character interactions are good enough to be in a top tier movie or series  Your choices matter and there is so much to say and do it's overwelming in the best possible way. The detail and interactivity in this game is mind blowing. Beautiful visually and sonicly. Should get game of the century nevermind game of the year. The best video game I have ever played..period.",0.1
"This game has been a breath of fresh air for the gaming industry. Ever since the gaming industry has garnered popularity, microtransactions, and cash-cow garbage has been more prevalent with these modern gaming studios, even the companies with the big IPs are doing it **cough cough, BLIZZARD, cough cough**. It feels incredible playing an immersive game where I can explore a massive world and do the cool thing because Larian wanted to create a work of art that catered to what D&amp;D players and gamers alike wanted. Larian did their job making quite possibly one of the best games of all time, and I look forward to only playing games that follow the golden standard that Larian has set for the industry.",0.1

Make sure your in offline mode at start of character build to stop this or it's a full restart build if it happens. There is also no option to enlarge inventory screens. Icons are tiny at 4k.

"Excellent exploration but as soon as combat starts it gets boring. Looks great but lacks any form of facial customization besides color and has a total of 1 likeable full party member with absolutely terrible party management, it shouldn't take more than 10 clicks to give your inactive party member a new piece of kit. The camp overall is not very enjoyable with its layout changing every 5 minutes, meaning you have to find your party members new locations. And there are way too many active rolls that stop the flow of whatever it is you were doing with your party skill not mattering at all - sure you might have that history-expertise-man sitting next to you but he ain't going to help you with that dc 15 check. Oh and the UI isn't very good.",0.06
"I can honestly say; I haven't played a game that made me cry, cheered outload, laughed hysterically, or get angry like this game can. I'm on my first full playthrough and I've grown extremely attached to my companions. Astarion, La'zel, and Shadowheart. All of their characters are so different but I feel an actual connection to them. The story itself honestly could have ended at act II and I would have felt satisfied; it's just that good. The whole end to the second chapter was the best (by far) experience I've ever had in a video game rivaling fallout 4's brotherhood of steel ending or the last mission of halo 3. For the first time in a game I feel like my choices actually matter, and I can do things the way I would really do them if I were my character. Bravo Larion studios you knocked it out of the park.",0.1

Спасибо Larian Studios.",0.1
"This is the dream RPG come true. Played over 500 hour in the Early Access alone, and the full release has lived up to the hype and more. If you're going to buy one game this decade, let it be this one. There's never been a game with so much reactivity and player agency. There not a single boring fetch quest or collect X items to save character Y, all the quests comes with a natural flow as you progress and all characters feel alive. Almost every single NPC of the over 2000 in the game have some unique dialogue. You can enter every single house in Badlur's Gate and talk to every NPC there and many have hidden stories that can lead to quests. On the higher difficulty mode the AI isn't simply buffed with stats like every other game. Instead the AI gets smarter, and has access to more abilities and uses potions or the environment (like exploding barrels) to its advantage. On top of all this comes beautifully crafted environments and characters that will make you laugh, upset or even cry, not to mention the absolutely awesome music scores. This game's a must buy even if you are normally not fond of the genre.",0.1

"I made a Metacritic account solely for the purpose of rating this game a 10/10. Baldur’s Gate 3 is Larian Studios at their best, and what they’ve managed to accomplish with this release is nothing short of astonishing. Faerûn has never looked better, and Larian’s gorgeous depiction of the iconic D&amp;D setting is complimented by a well-written story told through a cast of memorable characters. The combat is smooth and exciting, the core mechanics are true to the source material (with some liberties taken to adapt to the digital medium), and the voice cast does a stellar job of bringing the world to life. Get ready for an unforgettable RPG experience!",0.1

"Just finished the game today and it's phenomenal. If you like old school turn-based RPGs or like D&amp;D you'll like this game. There is a ton of detail and Larian allows you to tackle situations in a multitude of ways. The story is fairly good and varies based off of player choice. Companions are well flushed out, albeit some can be frustrating at first. Only criticism would be that some companions are too willing to have romantic relationships with the player character with little effort. Overall this is one of the best games i've played in a long time. Larian's philosophy of releasing a full game with no paid DLC/microtransactions is a breath of fresh air.",0.1

"In a year full of ToTK, FFXVI, RE4, Diablo 4, etc. Baldur’s Gate 3 comes out of nowhere and smashes their hopes of winning GOTY. This is a once in a generation game. I envy the people playing their first time from the start. The journey is just amazing, the characters are so well fleshed out, and the world feels alive. The story is great and every single action has a reaction and it’s so good. I hope everyone gives this game a shot. If you thought “turn based games aren’t for me” give it a shot. This one is.",0.1
"this is just a great game where you have several solutions for every moment of the game and as many secretive ones. In bg3, you can be anyone you want. The drow is a barbarian without problems, a dragonborn with the multiclass of a sorcerer, a barbarian and a bard, also without problems. I am a person who was unfamiliar with dnd, I say that this does not interfere with playing and delving into the plot in any way.",0.1

Not only that but a studio who is for the first time in a long time pro-consumer, who delivers a bug-free, full game-play, experience, without pre-planned DLC and other anti-consumer strategies.

"It doesn't feel like a sequel to Baldur's Gate, but that being said, it is still a great game.

"Me está encantando el videojuego y eso que este género no ha sido nunca mi estilo, solían aburrirme y me costaba mucho entenderlos; Pues no sé que ha ocurrido que con este no puedo parar de jugar llevo más de 40 horas y no me canso. Es cierto que me he perdido con alguna misión alguna vez pero he **** muy poco en encontrar alguna guía o sugerencia que me haya mostrado el camino. El juego por lo que he leído tiene 12 niveles, actualmente voy por el 8. Los primeros 4 niveles me costaron muchísimo porque no paraba de morir una y otra vez, luego leyendo, resulta que los D&amp;D son así, empiezas con un nivel muy bajo y los enemigos no tanto por lo que una estrategia deficiente o pecar de excesiva temeridad va a desembocar en literalmente la muerte, pero transcurridos estos primeros niveles (que ya os digo, cuesta) la cosa sigue igual de difícil pero ahora tienes más margen de maniobra y si eres un poco listo en tu planteamiento de los ataques puedes salir airoso más veces de las que mueras. En definitiva me encanta. Le doy un 9 por no estar doblado al castellano ya que la voz es fundamental en un juego tan exageradamente narrativo como este. Entiendo que son muchísimas líneas de diálogo y traducir sería caro pero no imposible, además que mis 60 euros valen lo mismo que los 60$ de cualquier estadounidense el cual va a tener una experiencia muchísimo más inmersiva. Dicho esto si no te importa estar 120 horas mínimo leyendo sin parar el juego merece muchísimo la pena. Para mi no es el GOTY porque no es de 10 pero casi.",0.09

"It was a long time coming but the final product is finally here. I played it first when it was freshly released into the beta. While it was good and had outstanding potential it was not yet ready to come out of the oven. I have returned now that it has finally released and wow. This game is outstandingly good. The story is rich and combat is addicting if you enjoy TBS games. and by rich story I mean to say that you can play through multiple times using different classes and taking different approaches, all resulting in a totally different story being told. Perhaps you saved an NPC who comes into play later and helps you. Perhaps you left them to die and you run into their allies who blame you for the death. Everything is so intertwined with the world that it provides an exceptional sense of immersion. That small act could snowball into something else which will impact future events. And the level ups, oh boy the level up. I was super turned off by the low level cap as it sounded terrible. Until I started leveling that is. You really feel each level up. No need go level 5 times only to get a small and ultimately minuscule boost and maybe one new skill in hopes of beating that boss. Each level up will grant a variety of boons and bonuses depending on your build. Talk to animals as a druid, bash in the skull of everything as a berserker, speak with the dead as a cleric, play the lute and perform over-dramatized dialogue options as a bard, the possibilities are limited only by your own imagination. You can pick up a goblin and beat another goblin to death with them. I mean do I really need to explain more? 10/10 would recommend.",0.1

It is a masterclass in immersion, effortlessly drawing you into its lore, making every decision feel consequential, and rewarding exploration with layers upon layers of depth. Truly, 'Baldur's Gate 3' is not just a game, but an adventure for the ages. 10/10",0.1

The game is beyond smooth for just releasing, something that has been lost on our current standards of a new release.

"Baldur's Gate 3 is a shining example of gaming perfection. Larian Studios deserves applause for crafting a captivating experience that immerses players in a rich narrative. The attention to detail, from visuals to sound, is commendable. The game captures the essence of Dungeons &amp; Dragons with depth in storytelling and character interactions. The combat system, class options, and character progression are well-balanced and engaging. In an era of rushed releases, Baldur's Gate 3 stands out as a testament to dedication and craftsmanship, setting a new standard for excellence in gaming.",0.1

"This is as close to a DND sit down session as I've ever played in a video game. I play DND weekly and this game is a love letter to tabletop gaming with the romance of a book and the visuals of a AAA title. With so many little things coming in to play that can change each encounter based on your race , class or certain skills it adds a lot of replayability.  For my taste this is the best RPG I've ever played because it's as close as you can get to what the mind can make up when sitting with friends around the DND table.",0.1

"Storytelling, cinematics, graphics, co-op, local co-op, combat, true permutations, companions, options, blah blah blah blah blah.. the list goes on and on. This game has it all. This game reminds me of the golden days of gaming. Knights of the Old Republic, Mass effect, Dragon age. This game acts a true successor to what a masterpiece is for its time. It’s passion. It’s love. No dlc. No micro transactions. No bulls***. Please, if there’s ever a video game you’re going to play, let it be this one.",0.1
"This is the best game ever written and created. Growing up with D&amp;D as well as all the baldur's gate games, this was the successor I was waiting for. Being a forever DM for tabletop games I never had a chance to experience a well structured world. This gave me the opportunity to play all my characters I have created in my head over the years and do pretty much anything I want to do in a world.",0.1

"This is the absolute pinnacle of gaming. From somebody who has never had a Metacritic account until now, never played any or know any of the rules of dnd. This game is a masterpiece, I was born in 2001 and was a kid when these groundbreaking video games were coming out and just thought it was normal for groundbreaking games like this to be the norm. However, as I have gotten older my love for video games hasn't changed but the passion I have for it has. That feeling of excitement of getting home to play a game like I'm a kid again has returned, I'm thankful to Larian Studio to put all their love and effort into this game and making me remember what true passion for a game feels like.",0.1

"Absolutely one of the best games I've played. You'll probably find the occasional bug here and there.

SUPPORT GOOD DEV'S WITH YOUR MONEY. Stop supporting horrible business practices. Vote with your wallet. Do not give anymore of your money to Blizzard or Bio-Ware or any other corrupt microtransaction pushing shady sales tactic abusive company. I am voting with my wallet from now on. Larian Studios is an amazing company and this game is an AMAZING throw back to days long past since games actually were worth $ and worth your time invested. This game is a great game and well worth the money spent you will get countless hours of enjoyment from it with the ability to replay it over and over again over 17000 different endings. Good luck completing all the content in this game. This is what games used to be and by voting with your wallet you can voice your opinion and steer the evil corrupt money making machine back in the favor of gamers.,0.1

I never doubted for a second that Larian would once again create an absolute masterpiece that would captivate even me, an absolute hater of turn-based combat. The game rightly sets new standards because there has never been such a great DnD game. Now that I'm playing the full version, it's more than just great. PS: There are so many more than just 200 hours of story, I already have 100 in the first act. Absolutely recommended for those who like RPG, good story and fantasy.",0.1

Truly a ONCE IN A GENERATION game. Probably the best computer role playing game ever made. Full voice acting and a system where your choices REALLY do matter means you can re-play this one with new classes and see totally new stuff. Very few games in history would deserver 10 out of 10 but Baldur's Gate 3 is one of them. It really does live up to the hype.,0.1
"top 3 rpgs as of right now, the game is so detailed and the story is so interesting and the characters are perfect very good cutscenes and amazing voice acting, complex combat man just get this game already",0.1
"At its core BG 3 is the closest anyone has come to putting a dnd experience on the computer while it should be noted if you have a problem with 5E you won’t like this as that is what the game is set in, if you have no clue what that means don’t worry about it. This is above and beyond the quality of rpg that fans of the genre have been craving since Dragon Age Origins, no other well known game short of Larian's own Original sin 2 came close to that level of rpg, but Baldur's Gate 3 while maybe not the continuation of the story told by Obsidian in 1 and 2 has in my eyes more then earned it's place next to those classics.",0.1

"I've never played a game like this before because I felt I wouldn't enjoy the combat style. The game did a great job of helping me get comfortable with the combat system. I love how many different ways you can play and how each class and race can really change the way things go for you. I haven't finished the game completely because I'm taking my time, but I'm enjoying my party members and the story so far.

Everything is reactive to what I do, who my character is, and most importantly they made custom origins much more appealing option.

I just finished the game after 30-40 hours spent with it. I was really enjoying it and I was ready to give BG3 the highest score possible but the ending really soured it for me. I really don't like how there always seems to be a way out of every situation imaginable but in the end you have to just sit and watch your companion die. Also why can't you keep playing after the final boss is dead? Straight to credits then all you can do is load a save. I was looking forward to completing all the side quests and finding all the secrets but now I won't. 5/10,0.05

I don't find that the game brings anything new; there's nothing in it that I haven't seen before, for instance, in Dragon Age: Origins. What Larian has done well is precisely that—doing everything well, but in my opinion, they've taken very few risks.",0.08
It’s the best Rollplay game that I ever played 10/10. I can highly recommend it to everyone who loves playing a different character.,0.1

"This Game deserves 10 points, it's a statement for what is possible. You find bugs, but you don't care if the game prove's to be excellent. You will enjoy the epic story and music, don't miss your chance.",0.1
I've been waiting for a truly good cRPG since Divinity: Original Sin 2. Giving the Baldur's Gate 3 license to the same studio was the best option. BG3 is amazing and the freedom and versatility has no ends. There are so many details and fun mechanics that you just need to do reruns to try it all out. This will be my top game for quite a few months and may not see an equal for quite a few years.,0.1
This is actually probably the greatest game I’ve ever played. There’s so much do do and it feels so complete. This is what I think I’ve always wanted out **** my entire life. Would highly recommend everyone give it a shot.,0.1

"A week into playing the game and it has tied Fallout New Vegas as one of my favorite games of all time, this is the type of quality of game I expect from every big budget AAA, and AA studios to make and will hold them to. It is sad that almost all AAA games nowadays don’t even come CLOSE to reaching how good a game this one that Larian made here is.",0.1

"Baldurs gate is an amazing RPG that embody's what and RPG should look like, amazing story, great combat and no microtransactions to break emersion",0.1
This is the best game this year so far. Good Old RPG brought back to life in a new and better form. Gameplay is easy and smooth not mentioning that it will grab you and **** you up for many hours before you notice the passing of time. NPc characters are well designed and have personality. This should be new standard for at least RPG games.,0.1
"I'm still in Act 1 after playing round about 30 hours and that game gave me more joy than everything I've played so far.. Not a single second I felt like I'd wanna take a break or something.

And every day I discover something new for myself in this game! I don't think even Starfield can take my attention away from Baldur's Gate. Definitely - this is my game for the next few years, which I will replay more than once. I want to see it all!",0.1

Years of RPG was enough to satiate our hunger. The most beautiful RPG game ever made after The Witcher 3. Congratulations and thanks for the Turkish language option Larian!,0.1

Just a quality game with a lot of love and care put into it. I'm 60 hours in still not finished so hesitant to give it a 10 just yet, but it's very much looking like a game that perfectly executes on it's promises.",0.09

"Absolutely love this. I finished Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 multiple times years ago, they are probably the two of my favourite games of all time. Baldur's Gate 3 is a worthy successor. Just amazing. The one thing I am not a fan of is the switch to turn-based system from the real time with optional pauses - but it's only a minor issue (and I guess it also serves portability to consoles).",0.1

"The thing that I don't hear from a lot of people that make this game so good is that they have created a game that can be as woke as any game can be but at the same time you don't have to deal with any of it. That alone for me in 2023 is worth 7 stars but I give this a 10 because it is meticulously crafted in all of its elements from story telling to combat and beyond. Great multiplayer experience, great solo experience, great viewing experience even as there are so many choices its unlikely anyone is going to have the same playthrough. Kudos to Larian for such a wonderful game",0.1
"This game absolutely deserves a 10/10. You can tell the entirety of the developers heart and soul were poured into this game. Great story, telling, attention to detail and combat. To those giving it a 0 because they think its rigged and people are falsely giving it 10/10's.. you deserve to play games made by Blizzard and EA forever.",0.1

"I'm not gonna give any game a 10/10 but if this is your type of game then it is pretty close. Just to get it out of the way, I think the biggest issue with the game right now is its questionable performance even with DLSS enabled. There are multiple areas where the FPS gets really choppy. Movement and combat can also be a bit clunky and annoying and Ive run into some really frustrating bugs like a chest that I spent many lock picks getting into which then gave me a huge pain trying to actually access it before eventually flying off the screen in a straight line and disappearing. But beyond that, the game itself is really very well done and probably one of the most immersive games I have ever played. I won't ramble, if you are looking into this game you know how well regarded it is. I look forward to not only completing the game, but playing it again and again over the years hopefully.",0.09
"Sets standard for co-op games. The co-op feature is fully independent, each player can pop-in to the others dialogue and battles. It's also friendly to non-gamers since combat is turn-based, it can be easily learned.",0.1

"I haven’t had such a true gaming experience in years. I’m reminded of the impressive RPG world of Dragon Age Origins, and the joy of multiplayer battle mode in Mario Kart. This game checks so many boxes. Last night I played couch coop mode with my girlfriend who has never played a video game before and she loved it. Giving this game a 10/10 is unfair unless all other 10 games get demoted to 9. My new favorite game, by a long shot.",0.1
Overall this game is a perfect 10 for me. So many dialogue options and the RPG elements are just next level. I spent over an hour in just character customization. With over 50 hrs of game time I can confidently say it's game of the year for me.,0.1

Not many developers these days are capable of releasing an actually finished product, which is pretty sad, but goddamn did these guys do their job and some. Game of the year material, period.",0.1
This might be the best crpg game that I have ever played. It is so close to the DnD experience that it blows my mind. They have poured so much love into this game and you can tell. The writing is top notch and the visuals is nothing short of amazing. The turn based combat system might not be for everyone but I beg you to give it a try and you'll find that you will pick it up quickly and it makes the game more fun. I hope that over devs look to this as a new benchmark in what games should be when they are released.,0.1

One of my absolute favorite things to do is read item descriptions because you can just tell how much fun the devs had in making the game from reading ‘em.

Also, before the game's release, turn-based role-playing games were considered dead. Even the recently released Final Fantasy 16 attempting swith into an action RPG.

The characters all well design with lively animation capture expressions and each npc you talk to then at least twice they give different dialogues and expression.

"I really don't get all the 10/10's. Did this game reinvent the wheel? No. It's okay but it's nothing extremely groundbreaking, I do understand I was not a huge Divinity fan - and this game feels like another Divinity game. It's all there. But I suppose if you are a pen and paper D&amp;D nerd your head will explode as now its D&amp;D meshed with Divinity. I respect Larian but come on... Do you really have to add beastiality to a video game? Isn't it enough that you can join the idiot woke crusade in the D&amp;D world (why it has any place there is beyond me). Everyone made such a big deal about 'spending hours in character creation' - then I got the game and just wondered to myself what the hell everyone is smoking - must be that fluoride in the water; you pick on of five or six faces, add hair, add facial hair, makeup, scar (all pre-made options), and then... Get ready... You pick your genitals... If you want a **** you have three choices, **** is two. How anyone sat in the character creation for an hour, or two or three, is insanity. Maybe people got excited because you can have a female, sorry, non-binary with a full beard. Or perhaps it was the amazing addition of vitiligo. People then rave about the visuals; it looks like the same old engine used back in 2017... Oh wait, it is that engine with a few tweaks. It gets the job done, but seriously, it's not setting any bars in that department. Voice acting is on par with DOS2. And the gameplay is on par with DOS2. Then you have the people freaking out that BG3 is now, get this, the highest rated game of 2023. I guess I was in another dimension because it's been pretty bleak in regards to interesting games being released. Good for Larian but be realistic. If Hollywood puts out nothing but the same trivial crap like Marvel and another Liam Neeson clone of Taken, and someone releases something that was highly anticipated and it scores high on release, it's kind of a win by default out the gate. I get that I am in the minority, and massively so, but I just don't have Larian's bit dripping out of my mouth that I failed to swallow and I don't drink the Kool-Aid.",0.06
"A once in a generation game. No micro transactions. No seasonal bs. No in game shop with $20 cosmetics. This is an example of what games should be in their purest state. The passion of this game burns so bright I can’t remember the last time I was so enticed to spend 60 hours on the game and not even finish 1/4 of the content yet. Not because had to go it slow, but because I wanted to explore every nook and cranny. This is one of the best games of all time and it sets the gold standard by witch I will compare every game going forward. Larian studios is punching above their weight with this one. Bloodydam fantastic. 10d10 out of 10",0.1
"For how long this game was in early access, theres no excuse for how bad the character creation is. Really embarrassing to make a dnd roleplaying game then give players no choice in making the character they're roleplaying as. I also don't think they added enough new characters. Theres a couple, but its mostly the same as early access. Who made the decision to cap levels at 12? This makes it challenging to multiclass effectively. I do think the combat system is pretty awesome, I like the different personalities and how they all have issues that the player doesn't necessarily like, it makes them seem more real. I like how choices affect gameplay. But that being said, I dont think this game really compares to dnd and i dont think theres any excuse to overlook things like basic character creation in a 2023 rpg. Skyrim literally did a better job.",0.06

I'm only partway through Act 2 and already I feel the need to leave some positive words in a public forum. This game is a treasure. The depth of experience here is one of a kind. There are so many ways to play and express yourself - I'm at a loss for words. I feel lucky to be able to have something like this. It's been a breath of fresh air in this chaotic world.

This needs to be the norm in modern gaming. Masterpiece.",0.1

"Not sure how, but somehow I didn't even see this game coming, and only really heard about it from friends. I have no regrets getting the game and have been having a great time with it. It even has a bit of nostalgia for me, reminding me of other DnD centric games that I played many many years ago.  Excellent story telling, gameplay engaging, and paced just right for me.  (I admit turn based may not be for everyone, but hey not everyone is perfect right?) If you are new to DnD systems, the learning curve may be a bit intimidating, but never fear, there is plenty of help available online.   Worth every dollar.",0.1
"The game is all that a CRPG fan could dream of, and then more. The writing is superb, the voice acting is unparalleled, and the whole story is ripe with choice and consequence. Me and my partner played separately and we both ended up playing a completely different game. It's just absurd how good this game is. I won't say it's the best game ever, because it's hard to tell with just one week since release, but it's definitely a genuinely amazing experience like no other I remember, and I'm old enough to have played BG1 and 2 when they were released.",0.1

While doing this, it expertly adds on to the story of the world from the tabletop version of DnD while incorporating the legacy of the two initial Baldur’s Gate games. Larian Studios has simply created a masterpiece!",0.1
"Larian did not disappoint. This game is in my opinion the best adaptation of dnd system there is. The system doesn't hold your hand, you can choose yourself how you want to play the game, with endless choices. What I also like is the heaviness of those choices. Even things that don't seem important at first might impact your playthrough. With that comes a great multiple playthrough potential. You can choose if you want to be a knight in shining armor, saving everyone on your way to glory, or if you want to become the next funny mustache man, pillaging and murdering everyone you see. This is quite frankly the best crpg I've ever played",0.1

"Game of the Decade. I don't say that lightly considering how incredible games have been these past few years. Larian took high expectations and exceeded them. They are a heartwarming story of an underdog studio making a AAA game of all AAA games. There is so much QUALITY in this game that it makes AAA studios look like kittens. I don't know why it's so difficult nowadays for most studios to deliver a complete game from the very beginning that focuses on the consumer experience rather than making money with things like DLC or unlock artificial experience blockers. Larian didn't fall prey to the looter-shooter facade where you need to collect tons of random gear that they can then force you to pay-to-win for the best. There is so much to do in this game but not like Assassin's creed nonsense where you get inundated with side quests after side quests. There is so much hand crafted story telling, so many cutscenes, interactions, and reactions to who you are and the choices you make that it makes it feel like a real, breathing world. BG3 delivers an experience of the decade all for just one price while making other bigger studios look like amateurs. You can really tell this development team has such an amazing passion for making games and making the player enjoy the experience.",0.1
"This is the best RPG I have played in a very long time. I personally preferred Divinity Original Sin 2's combat, but everything else here is improved from visuals, story, quality of life, cutscenes, etc. This is a rare find in the modern gaming landscape and you are doing yourself a dis-service if you are an RPG fan who does not try this. Also, you do not need to know anything about D&amp;D to enjoy this game, the experience is even better if you do.",0.1

"Apparentrly a great portion of players have all lost their minds; no progression; a system of magic twisted and completely unbalalanced  with all cothers classes and the worst a complete combat system based on cheated dice roll for the IA and characters and monsters controlled by the computer, the 3 difficulty correspond with 3 dset of so called random roll dices, all combat is  controlled by cheated roll dice , the tactical  is completely wzasted by cheated roll dice.  No set of equipement fo characters , 20hours to achievce lvl5 seriously, no decent set of equipement, all the univers is wasted by convoluted and cheated combat...pure garbage",0.04

A project that took 6 years made by a rare, classy and passionate video game studio, who not only have the expertise of making RPGs, but to also to listen and relying with the community to make what we are witnessing right now. Larian Studios had done it again, and this the breakout that they needed and deserved. This game will be remembered as one of the all time best modern games around, and definitely will set the new standard of RPGs. This is really a love letter for not only D&amp;D fans, but the old-school gaming and RPGs in general. God Bless, Larian.",0.1

Also, it's been quite a few years since I've had to debate whether or not I'm going to call in sick to work just so I can keep playing a video game. This game is easily in my top 5 all time and something I will most likely end up putting 400+ hours into. 105 hours so far and counting. If you're a fan of RPG's but don't like isometric and/or turn based combat video games, I still highly recommend giving this game a chance. Buy it on Steam, MAKE A CHARACTER QUICKLY, and just play for an hour.",0.1

Now 8 years later I discover Baldur's Gate 3 and my first D&amp;D experience. I'm like 40 hours into the game and I guess close to the end of the first chapter (yes, there's quite a steep learning curve for a novice like myself) but what a blast this is! Everything in this game is TOP-NOTCH: the voice acting, the narrative, the graphics, the soundtrack, the gameplay, the cutscenes, the possibilities... and so on.  Just WOOOOOW !!!  All my respect for the people  (I should call them artists) who made this. Larian Studios from Belgium, hail to you. Thank you.",0.1

This game has become a classic. Thank you Larian Studios for the new standard rpg,0.1
"The game is beyond expectations. The goblins are so likeable. I've resurrected and interrogated nearly every corpse I've encountered. I've forced Shadowheart to switch classes to a Shadow Monk ( much more befitting IMO) because there's only room for one Trickery Cleric in this group. I've permanently lost several companions (sorry Gale, but a true friend is someone you can trust with all your secrets) and I can already imagine 10 other ways I'm going to play through this game. I hope Armored Core gets delayed...",0.1
"Great successor to the original series. Stunning cinematics. Story that provides depth. Satisfying combat. A game that makes you feel like they respect your intelligence. It makes you feel like it’s not dumbed down for the masses, ald at the same time isn’t overly complicated either. A lot of spells, but no one says you have to use all of them if you don’t want to. Choices have consequences. Will be playing for a long time. Contrast with the letdown D4 just proved to be could not be greater.",0.1
SO much to do and experience. The dialogue is amazing and with quicksave you can experience every line if you wish. Game is a winner. Larian studios just knocked it out of the park into space.,0.1

What makes me laugh is idiots giving this game score 0 for being a true cRPG, because apparently it's too slow, too strategic, with dice rolls, blah blah. Go play Fortnite and let others enjoy this type of game. It's like me going to play Fortnite or Apex Legends and giving it 0 for being too shallow, too fast and too primitive",0.1

the best surprise of the year. Definitely deserved the GOTY. No words can describe how much fun I have playing this game with my friend. So many choices and unexpected plots. Out of the box and the developers deserves to be praised.,0.1
Congratulations Larian and thank you so much for making not only an amazing game but doing Dnd justice and finally giving us a great game in the universe. Everything in this game is so well done and I wish I could give Larian more money.,0.1
It deserves a 10 for the sheer ambition and bold vision. It will be a serious contender for game of the decade. I hope this becomes a model that inspires future developers to deliver quality content.,0.1
"What an incredible game this is! There is so much to do and so many different ways you can play. I would say that my only issue I've had is that it's a bit overwhelming at first. But after a few hours, you start to really set in. This might be the best game I've ever Played. 10/10",0.1

"I really only bought this game because I loved BG 1&amp;2. I wasn't that excited for it, but playing it has been really enjoyable. There are a lot of in depth quests and choices to make, and combat feels good. I'm not a huge fan of the stat checks, as you can have a character with +10 roll a 1 and fail, or a character with -10 roll a 20 and succeed. There are some creative ways to get around failed checks, but sometimes it feels like I'm going to miss out on content on a fail so I'll just reload. Overall, I like the 5e rules which offer much more customization than the first two games, I just need to get over looting every single thing I see so I can make some progress in the game.",0.1
"What an amazing game. +50h and not even finished act I. Extremely engaging.  I could stop playing it right now and it would still worth the money. Well done Larian, again.",0.1
"Masterpiece.  Replicated 5e d&amp;d perfectly.  I don't know how they managed to allow so much player choice, from throwing your small companions and sneaking into a basement through a hole as a mage hand or cat - it is just incredible.  The story is great and the dialogue choices are unique.  I can't wait to replay as other classes too.  One of the greatest games ever made that I'll be playing for years.",0.1
"Baldur's Gate 3 consegue trazer elementos do RPG de mesa para um jogo eletrônico como eu jamais vi. Os personagens tem personalidade e história únicos, com segredos e ambições individuais que torna tudo muito imprevisível. Aqui não temos o arquétipo dos heróis puramente bonzinhos, não comuns nos RPGs ""de plástico"", e isso é ótimo! A exploração é recompensadora pois além de grande o mundo é denso. Eu não tinha hype nenhum sobre este jogo, mas confesso que hoje tenho a sensação de estar jogando o melhor RPG da década! Gostaria de estar jogando ele no Xbox Series X, mas até lá estou adorando a experiência no PC.",0.1

"The Best rpg game ever play ! Storys, characters, skill, decisionss, the art… the goty without discussion",0.1
"I have been playing Baldur's Gate 3 for a few  years during the Early Access times. Once the game fully released, I have been enamored with how in depth and elaborate every aspect of the game is. For someone who has been playing DnD as a DM for over 10 years, I could see why some people might not like the game since it does have dice rolls and skill checks for many aspects of the game. The turn based combat is also just like DnD in that players roll for initiative and then characters go in the order that they rolled. Same with the character development, as DnD offers almost limitless combinations for your character to choose from. This is the closest iteration of a true to form video game adaptation of DnD that I could imagine, so well done Larian Studios!",0.1
"The Elden Ring Magic, Absolutly stunning. Never Play DnD. Will do again. Everything feels perfectly planed.",0.1
Larian Studios have managed to create something that feels like the spiritual successor to Dragon Age: Origins and might just have set the new RPG standard for years to come,0.1

"If you played divinity OS 2 , this is putting the baldurs gate lore on top of a that engine, with improved graphics and awesome voice acting that sell the story really well. IF you have never played a crpg before, it is a bit daunting and overwhelming at first just fight through that initial struggle and you wont regret it. Oonce you learn the game mechanics and a little patients, few games have been this rewarding and exciting for me since the witcher 3.",0.1

"I'm another early 2000s N64/Xbox/Halo guy who never really experienced top down games or never thought it would peak my interests. It was always fps and third person shooters. After hearing about this game through the decreasing population of Diablo 4 and its lack of Endgame, I needed anything to fill the void. I ended up buying this with my brother and it's been one of the most unique experiences in gaming I've ever had in my 20 years. The strategy and chess mindset involved is something I never thought a game could be. If you don't plot your moves and turns right, the game gets pretty demanding and challenging, which is a great thing. The challenge is there, the soundtrack is beautiful (think Fable, Kingdoms of Amalur), the graphics are beautiful in they're own comfortable way, similiar to that of Diablo 4 or Path or Exile (I personally love that style). Last but not least the gameplay and story both sit way above water and Id give them both a 9. On top of all the other attributes this game brings to the table, along with such a custom and unique path and dialogue system, this game gets a 10. The last time I gave a 10 to a game was Uncharted 4 so this says something. To all fps guys who never really tried something like this. Give it a try and sit with it for a few hours.",0.1

"I know 40 hours in is a bit early to review a 100+ hour game, but I imagine at this point, my mind is not going to change. This is the best CRPG in recent memory, hand's down. They adopt some modern elements while still sticking to the classic role playing game format. Everything about this game is so well done. Between it's polish, graphics, character interactions, customization, turn-based battle system, writing, and sound design, everything about this game screams masterpiece. It's so refreshing seeing a game like this, full release, no mtx, no battlepass, single player (with option for co-op), doing so well in a world ran by soul ****, micro-transaction laden corporate games. The concurrent player numbers on Steam (hitting the over 800k milestone the week of release) just goes to show that gamer's still love these experiences. So far, it is my GOTY. It offers everything I could have asked for and more. Huge thanks to Larian Studios for this amazing experience!",0.1

"Created an account just to give this game a rating. It's mind-boggling the amount of content, permutations, and attention to detail in this game.

I haven't played it much yet due to personal reasons but just the few hours I've spent were quite amazing. You really have the feeling of being part of a story and no greed from the studio.

Great story, characters and lots of choices that actually matter. Combat system is good aswell, only part some ppl might miss is a Realtime with pause mode some other RPGs have, but I like Turnbased more since its less chaotic. Only critique is character pathing.

Leaving this review so more company's will try to match larians level. The game is 10/10 and im hoping for it to beome game of the year.,0.1
GOTY in my heart!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0.1
"A masterpiece of the decade, 10 out of 10. You won't find such variability in any other game. I hope other developers will realize that games should be made like this, but the main thing is for publishers to understand it.",0.1

"This game is a gem that we must all treasure and enjoy. It is a labor of love made by gamers for gamers. Truly the most accurate representation of a D&amp;D board game brought to our gaming machines. Moreover this game is huge and was not sliced into pieces to be sold separately, which in this day and age should be seen as a remarkable display of backbone and integrity. I almost cried happy tears when I realized what we have here and I hope that Larian will never sell their IP, because this is what we need in order to have the games that we deserve.",0.1

"Good game, I'm glad Larian finally made it, ever since the early access I knew it'll be awesome.",0.1
"Game of the year! 11/10 The game is wonderful. This could be the end of the review, but I'll write about the emotions of a person who likes to play classic RPGs. Firstly, I'm shocked by the graphics, I can't get enough of the characters. The scenes are set perfectly. Dialog options are also more than enough. The game has grown a lot and I say this from a height of 400 hours in early access and observations of its development. I also really like the fights and the step-by-step approach gives me huge options for tactics. I get sincere pleasure from immersion in the game, from communicating with companions, from interesting fights. I love the first parts of Baldur's Gate 1, 2 with all my heart, but the fights there frankly bored me from the first hours of the game. Communication with satellites there was also not enough for me. Everything is fine for me here. And it looks like I will spend hundreds and hundreds more hours in this game.",0.1

"Baldur´s Gate 3 is a great game, putting us deep into a great world. Fun fights, great characters, great graphics, awesome sound effects and breathtaking music. A fun story, meeting many old chars from the previous games, Would recommend to play this to everyone.",0.1

"First time I’ve ever left a review on Metacritic, thank you Larian it’s everything you could dream of!",0.1
"This game is even more amazing than it was during early access. The story is really great, alongside the combat, the immersive world.. it is really hard to find a negative point about the game",0.1
"Simply just wow. This is not setting a new standard for RPGs, this is setting a new standard for the whole game industry.",0.1
"Best game ever, love it. Can't get enough. The problem with newer games like Diablo 4 is the people being them",0.1
AAA studios pay attention. This game feels complete on launch and even as someone whose last Turn based game was FF7 &amp; FF8... this is a fun way back into the genre! Polar opposite of the disaster that was Diablo 4!,0.1
BG3 is such a fairy-tale from beginning to end. Easiest recommendation of my life.,0.1

"As someone who couldn't get into Divinity Original Sin 2 and has never been a CRPG fan, this is an absolute masterpiece. Do you ever play RPGs and are impressed by great rare RPG mechanic, choices that really do matter, quality characters, great customizability, fun loot? This game is that nonstop. I imagine once I finish this I will be going back and giving DOS2 another chance.",0.1

I joined the U.S. Navy when I was 18 (it was 1981) my friends and I played on the ship (while at sea) on the weekends and holidays for HOURS. Now, I'm 60, and THAT GAME is on my PC, just like I remember it.  If you have ever played D@D, Get This Game.",0.1
"Playing BG3 after a 3 year break from early access has me completely enchanted all over again. With a combined effort of patience and early access player feedback, the Larian team has crafted a masterpiece. With this fantastic effort (and of course the Divinty IP), Larian has perfected the CRPG ""secret sauce"". I'm hopeful both Wizards of The Coast (@wizards) and Larian (@larianstudios) build on this success, and of course more epic tales in Faerûn !",0.1

"I am not much of a CRPG fan. The last memorable game I enjoyed was Pathfinder but I’m more of a ARPG fan such Diablo, Path of Exile, Last Epoch etc. But this game has to be the very best CRPG experience, I have had, in years. Amazing depth, choices matter, multiple different outcomes from the most simple to complex events, taking the very best of table top experience, perfecting it into a digital medium with very satisfying gameplay. Extremely pleasing rolling that die from dialogue to combat. If you have yet to experience this genre of video games then start off here in Baldur’s Gate 3. Extremely easy to pick up and play. No need to master the rules or proper ways to build your character etc. Just purchase, download, adjust initial settings and enjoy. The characters are interesting, the story is good and the gameplay is clean. Stop reading and play. Oh wait! If you have a friend then invite them as well. The multiplayer works well and is a blast.",0.1

"Melhor RPG de todos os tempos, estamos presenciando uma verdadeira obra revolucionária assim como Skyrim foi em sua época.

Dito isso, Baldur's Gate 3 é muito mais do que um jogo de RPG, e sim uma experiência belíssima da mais alta qualidade, recomendo à todos.",0.1

However, nearly everything else in this game has been wonderful in my 30 hours played so far. I'm still only part way through Act 1 on Tactician as a D&amp;D novice, but there's just so much there for a player like me to go through (including each container or shelf... lord help me).",0.1

The amount of detail and effort the developers have poured into this game is truly remarkable. It's like witnessing a masterpiece in its purest form.

"Baldur's Gate 3 is a masterpiece. And most importantly it is the best example of ethical game development. My OCD wishes there was an easier way to alter a character once created. This game provides the best video game way of playing D&amp;D, and adds vertical aspects that are often missed in a table top game.",0.1
"Absolutely fantastic, give them your money. I played the game in EA and I have to say that it lived up the my expectations within reason. Some issues I expected they would have do exist but its still one of the best games this decade so far.",0.1
BG3 is the game that was completely released without bugs.  We rarely get to say that these days. So I already know I want more.,0.1

"It's pretty rare a game succeeds on all fronts like this one does. The characters, story and overall writing are excellent. This is a game world I love to feel immersed in. Additionally the combat while challenging is fun due to its open nature. It feels like I have a lot of control over how I interact with people, tackle different situations and approach fights. Most games feel pretty handholdy and linear these days so this is a breath of fresh air and I can see why it's getting so much attention.",0.1
"Might be one of the greatest games, certainly one of the greatest RPGs, ever made. Contender for GOTY but alas, Zelda (and it's legions of fanboys) doth exist. Please, please, GOTY this game (Though we've yet to see Starfield, with it's 1,000+ planets from Bethesda, September 6th). Fingers crossed. 5-6 hours into the game, and I'm already planning a second playthrough as a completely different character.  To digest this game you need a couple of hundred hours for sure.

"Passion project... When you see something that was worked on as a passion project you know it. When someone has built something as a passion project, you can see the attention to detail. The corners perfectly shaped, or the lines perfectly drawn. Larian has given us their passion project with this game. It is a masterpiece. Masterpiece is a work I have only used a few times to describe a game. Larian has earned this word. Do not miss this game, for those of you that are thinking ""eh, maybe one day I'll play it"". When that day comes, you will then say ""Why did I wait so long to experience this!""",0.1
"I have been waiting for it for some time, haven't played early access or anything. I have played Divinity 2 and Baldur's Gate 2, and i have to say that for the hours that i currently have played, i have never seen a game with a level of detail on everything as in this game. Everything, is so well done, almost perfect if not perfect, combat, a depth i've seen in very few games, quests ,stories ,characters never seen this level in other games, attention to details, few games. The amount of hours and replayability that this game has are not of this world, and every one of them with this quality... Honestly i have no words, we are probably with a game of the decade next to zelda or probably gta 6 when comes out, and by far the best rpg that has ever been done.",0.1
"Baldurs Gate 3 is a triumph of gaming and return to form for CRPG fans who have patiently waited for the 'next big thing'. This game feels fresh, expansive, and gives players the choice to play the game in a remarkable number of ways. One of those 'special' and rare once in a decade games that sets the bar for other game developers to strive for. The bar has been set with BG3 and I don't think it will dethroned for the foreseeable future. Run, don't walk to pick this one up. BG3 has rolled a perfect 20 on the die with this release. Brilliant and genius, almost puts other triple A developers to shame. BG3 has NO MICROTRANSACTIONS, no DRM (no Denuvo), and has released in a largely bug free state. Game is very consumer friendly and respectful.",0.1
"What an incredible RPG! Great story/characters, unparalleled voice acting, incredible depth of gameplay and dialogue, and the best turn based combat in the whole genre. I'm 30 hours in and can't stop playing. It could well match of surpass my previous favourite game of all time - their last game. Worth playing even if you don't generally like CRPG's - it's not beholden to the past, nostalgia, or old convetions,  it pushes the genre into the future.  Well done Larian!",0.1

"TOP studio created TOP game, maybe the best RPG in these days. For total perfection is missing my native Czech language and tuned functional controller (on PC)  (currnetly works , but weird, only in COOP/ split screen mode,",0.09
"As a huge fan of the Baldur Gates franchise this might be the biggest disappointment of all time and I am not exaggerating. The game literally looks like a playstation 2 graphics despite requiring a souped-up laptop to play. Controller support is nonexistent so enjoy playing it with a mouse and keyboard (IN 2023!!). And don't get me started on the historical inaccuracies.. But worst of all is the story which I won't spoil but rest assured it is a huge slap in the face of the long term fans of the franchise who grew up playing Siege of Dragonspear and hanging out on the subreddit, sharing tips and tales with the awesome community. At this point I honestly believe it would have been better to NOT make a new Baldur Gates so we can keep the great memories instead of this cash-in garbage.",0.0
"The best game I've played in 10+ years. An absolute masterpiece. Story, characters, gameplay, variability, attention to detail, graphics - everything is at an incredible high level. I can't believe that this game could come out in our time. 10/10",0.1
"A competent CRPG from the post-quality age. I could write a list of glaring faults (example: no text or voice chat in multiplayer) so long that your eyes would glaze over. Other than that, the game narrowly skates by on the enjoyability of its mechanics. Not a 0/10, not a 10/10; it is truly insane to suggest either score.",0.06
Best game ever! Best studio ever. Care about the consumer. Most addicting thing ever played,0.1
"High-quality cutscenes, in-depth dialogues, rich exploring, good optimization and decent turn-based combat you need to think on, and of course possibility of sex with bear LOL. The game has everything we've dreamt of so far. If Starfield does not end up as good as this game, Baldur's Gate 3 is a top candidate for GOTY.",0.1
"Finally a triple-A game worth playing in a long time. Carefully crafted game with interesting storylines, amazing amount of content and no hidden costs. It just seems unbelievable.",0.1
"And yet again another outstanding work from Larian. Baldur's gate 3 remind me of the old days playing BG1 and 2. The story surprises you, makes you laugh and keeps you at the border of the chair. Combat is engaging and really enjoyable. It's incredible to see a game made with such love and dedication from a company that know and respect it's customers. Thank you, Larian. Keep the great work and never deviate from this path",0.1

Huge worlds and huge gameplay options, the content of this game is ridiculous. So much to explore, so much to do and with so many choices! Everything has an impact to the gameplay, yet still connects to the story! Many characters to get to know and with the lore to back them up. 51 hours in, just started Act 2.

Espero que mucha gente lo apoye, se seguirá hablando de este juego dentro de 20 años y veo extremadamente complicado que alguien lo mejore, como no sea la propia Larian y también complicado ya que ya han declarado que van a hacer juegos más pequeños.

Might just be the best game I’ve played, and I really mean that. It’s amazing. Play this game.",0.1
this game is amazing. it reminds me playing old Baldurs gate games and first Dragon age... but it is actually better in all possible ways.. I have played for 25 hours and it is still getting better and better.. roleplaying mechanics and options and ways to go with your character are just amazing.. it is just excelent game with hundreds of hours of FUN.  and fun is something that is missing in a lot of AAA games in recent years.,0.1

"Игра не без шероховатостей на старте, но на фоне халтуры, которая выходит в последнее время от крупных студий она является глотком свежего воздуха. Прошел DoS и DoS2 от Ларианов, являюсь поклонником серии. Играл в Бету БГ3 и был очень доволен. На данный момент всё ещё прохожу первый акт, который был немного переработан, столкнулся с парой мелких багов. В остально игрой очень доволен.",0.1
This game is huge in both ways: content and quality. Until now I played three sessions with my friends and we all are hyped for what's comming next every time!,0.09

"I haven’t been this astonished by a game since TW3 although this game is a much more deep RPG. The amount of probabilities and choices just by playing or using different characters is incredible. A pure labour of love without any micro transactions, season passes or other GaaS crap, well optimised and absolutely huge on content. Like a dream come true… buy this game to support this! I’ll buy it again on PS5 when it will release next month.",0.1
Great DND based RPG adventure for solo play or with friends. Highly recommended for those who like this genre.,0.1

Freedom and the ways how to approach every situation in this game is mind-gobbling to me. Larian proved once again that their team is so talented. If I could, I would personaly thank them for one of the most memorable experiences in my gaming carrier. I think that this game deserves rating of 11/10 :)",0.1

"Larian makes good RPG's and this is a game that is worth trying but after the hype this game created I am not satisfied with the game I play. I think problem is about D&amp;D. Both game rules and world are not interesting. I feel overwhelmed by the game when I try to play it. Open world makes it difficult to focus on an area. I still have high hopes about Larian Studios, I hope next game will be DOS3 instead of BG4.",0.07
The Ghrapics and the music is so good. The story? It's amazing. I've never played an rpg this good before! The choices in the game makes such an huge impact on the story and your companions. LARIAN! Amazing work and congratulations for your success. It's hard to find companies like yours today.,0.1
"Larian Studios delivers another masterpiece with the release of Baldur's Gate 3. Immerse yourself into this narrative-driven story as you embark on an epic adventure through one of the most history-rich fantasy worlds ever created. Larian's passion and attention to detail, combined with The Forgotten Realms lore, is the perfect recipe for one of the greatest CRPGs ever, and Larian definitely delivered that. They have surpassed most expectations and deserve the success this game is generating. Well done!",0.1

"A new standard for AAA gaming. We love our indies and would never expect them to put out this caliber ****, but big companies (EA, Blizzard, Ubisoft, ect) are terrified of how beloved this game is. So much effort was put into it and WITHOUT ANY MICROTRANSACTIONS OR LOOTBOXES! That's the reason Blizzard is hemming and hawing about this game. They have always said they need to have microtransactions to pay for their workers. BULL! Larian, if you were a person I'd kiss you. This is a top 3 game I have ever played. BRAVO!!!",0.1

"Baldur's Gate 3 is a rich and immersive gaming experience, although its dense content can at times feel overwhelming for new players. It certainly takes a few attempts to truly grasp its mechanics and nuances, but once you do, it's incredibly rewarding and downright addictive. What stands out the most are the intricate backstories of the characters; each one is laden with challenges that not only drive the narrative forward but also seamlessly tie into the broader storyline. Every quest feels purposeful and meaningful. I haven't been this captivated by a game since Dragon Age: Origins. In essence, Baldur's Gate 3 is nothing short of amazing.",0.1

This game has delivered on every front and exceeds my expectations of what an RPG can be. The cinematic experience is like being able to play out my own movie.,0.1
"I have played this game since early access and it's been amazing to watch it grow and evolve over time. It's polished, funny, dramatic, emotional, tactical, intriguing, and compelling. This is one of the greatest RPGs ever made and this is one of those games that everyone who loves the role-playing experience should check out for themselves!",0.1
The best RPG I have played in a very long time. Tabletop type combat and tons of choices for the dialog options. This is the game I have been waiting for my whole life for an RPG that is my story the way I want my story. Worth every penny of the price and better yet no microtransactions. You buy the game you get everything that is in the game. If you love RPG's you will love this game.,0.1

"Good game. One of few modern games with love and passion put into it. My favorite part about the game is how much choice you have, already from the start when making your character your choices will influence the story, all the way to how you speak to people and act.",0.1

"Easily one of the best games I've played in recent years. Story is amazing, graphics are great. Combat is slow but strategic. There is no micro transactions in this game which I find rare in popular games these days.",0.1
"Definitely one of the greatest RPGs of all time. Larian have been at the top of their game ever since Divinity: Original Sin 1. It plays a lot like an improved Divinity: Original Sin 2 with much more interesting characters, more attention to detail, excellent writing, crazy amounts of detail relative to the scope, and an IMO more interesting core game system and a much more interesting setting (D&amp;D's Faerûn). It does Baldur's Gate I-II justice and for once D&amp;D 5th edition doesn't feel cumbersome like almost all other video game adaptations do. Also, no DRM, no microtransactions, no lootboxes, no battle passes, no greedy cash grab DLCs, etc. If you like CRPG you have no excuse not to play this absolute masterpiece. Other than D:OS2, the only games that's even been remotely as good on the CRPG front  these past two decades are Dragon Age: Origins, Mass Effect 2, and NeverWinter Nights 2, and Knights of the Old Republic 1-2 yet Baldur's Gate 3 still manages to be leagues better than all of these.",0.1

"Best RPG ever. A true one as well unlike that cash grab Hogwarts Legacy using RPG to just get more players. I hope other studios apply the good parts Larian does here, somethings like no in game purchases, great voice acting, amazing and detailed story that tries to be natural and immersive.",0.1
,0.1
"A new gold standard for not only RPG's, but game design as a whole. While the game is rooted in the D&amp;D 5e ruleset that may present a steep learning curve for beginners, players will be quickly rewarded for learning the mechanics. The writing and world building here is a benchmark for gaming, and combat is satisfying in its habit of rewarding shrewd and creative positioning and party building. Easily a 150+ hour experience, stop reading reviews and go play this.",0.1
"This may be my favorite game of all time. So much story, beautiful graphics. Depending on the person I could understand its not their cup of tea, but how can there be any negative reviews for this masterpiece. Shame on you, negative reviews are for broken games and ones with ridiculous monetization.",0.1
"Not a fan of these western RPGs, the character design is awful, the 3/4 camera is very old school and there is absolutely nothing about this game to captivate me. Still I am able to recognize it is a great game for those who like the genre.",0.1
Absolutely love this game. I pre-ordered this as soon as I could. I loved Divinity Original Sin 1 and 2. This brings it to a whole new level,0.1
"An absolutely incredible rpg! From the dialogue to the characters to the horror to the humor it's all incredible. Please support this game, and Larian Studios. Larian made a 200 hour long COMPLETE game with full voice acting, fully mo-capped with dynamic camera angles, and unreal levels of freedom and reactivity, and they did it without any dlc, micro-transactions, loot boxes or any scummy AAA tactics. If you wanna spite corporate suits that demand more money while giving you less game, than supporting this game is how you do it. A couple bugs here and there, but they were all very minor, and did not detract from my enjoyment of the game at all.",0.1
,0.1
Incredible game!. It’s my first DND turn based game. I never liked that type of combat but I pushed through it and glad I have!. The story is so exceptionally detailed &amp; compelling. The characters your actually intrigued in hearing the story!. Visually it’s a masterpiece!. I’m playing on RTX 3080 with high settings in 4K getting over 100fps!. It’s very well optimised!. Only bug I found was a NPC getting aggressive with me when it shouldn’t have due to the story. But other than that top notch!. Can’t wait to see if the company will introduce a free movement style of combat in the future as that would make it perfect if this world was like that!,0.1
"This game is truly special.    It is truly rare in life to find something this comprehensive, deep, and robust.   If you want to learn more about RPGs, D&amp;D 5e, turn-based combat, etc., this game is for you.   If you already love RPGs, this is a true gem.  At launch, it was good, and it will only get better as it settles.   Larian Studios is an incredible developer, and I am very happy to see their success.",0.1

There is some bug here and there, sometimes navigating characters feel clunky like D4 horse (espetialy when you try to loot while moving and miss the object by even 0.01mm and some of them are small). But the 3 most important things are: Its fun, it has soul and its not trying to manipalate you.",0.1

"Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 defined my teenage gamer years. I'm so very glad the series has found a worthy developer to carry on the legacy of those older games -- and really, to exceed them in many ways. As far as I'm concerned this is as close to a perfect CRPG as we're ever likely to see. I hope this provides a foundation for a renaissance of digital Forgotten Realms content.",0.1

"Honestly one of the worst games I have ever played, and I don't even care that it is an Original Sin 2 clone and has nothing in common with Baldur's Gate. The game is very depraved, the dialogue is Reddit tier awful, and the combat is boring and slow. Never again.",0.0

I love this game. I played early acces for 25 hours. And now i have already spend next to 50 hours in the first part. I am a good boy in rl so i love stealing and doing bad things in BG3. The narrative is awsome. Malady's voice from Divnity 2 makes me feel warm and at home in this game. Larian i love you for making this game. Goed gedaaaan,0.1

This game is phenomenal. I find it odd people are criticizing the side characters in a game where you literally create your own story. The game runs at 60 fps on my ROG ally as well so maybe the people complaining should upgrade their 970s from 2014.,0.1

This team at Larian seems unreal, when you look at what is out there. They should be proud of what they have accomplished.",0.1

Proud of Larian for listening to feedback and always improving their product by listening to the community - let this set an example in the gaming industry.",0.1
"Rarely do I post a review after five hours play. I remember well the previous two titles even though I never played much of them in their day. I was sceptical about BG3 due to turn based more strategic combat. I was hooked the moment I started playing. This is a one of a kind video game with so much detail and love poured into its design. Everything is crammed with detail and choice. Visually it's sound, audio is sublime, gameplay is excellent and the pure freedom at every turn is mind blowing. This is rare for me to write and be knocked back by a game in modern times...over 40 years in gaming and BG3 has restored faith that a dev team still makes real games with heart and soul. Never played D&amp;D games but know of it. That's irrelevant as it's an incredible gaming experience regardless of your choice of interests.",0.1
"Best game I've played in a long time. Great graphics, strategic and deep gameplay, sublime story",0.1
This is a definition of 10/10 game. I missed the original Baldur's Gate. Time to catch up. Thanks Larian!,0.1
I didnt think it was possible for them to make a baldurs gate as good or even better than BG2. But here we are 23 years later and BG3 deserves the praise of being one of the best RPGs ever,0.1

One of the best games I have played recently. I have had an excellent time playing this game my one complaint is the camera controls at certain times I've had to battle the camera angles and control of it. Other than that this game is a masterpiece. Other then needing a few bug fixes which should be fixed in no time excellent game 9/10,0.09

A labour of love, a genuine work of art.  If your not a fan of CRPGs then it maybe less attractive to you but it still could be worth trying, you may get into it. Industry wise it represents something more: full game, no microtransactions, no season pass, no BS and so far constantly delighting and surprising me by over delivering.",0.1

"Was hopeful that a game that was 120 GB to download wouldn't have as many broken cut scenes... I'm like at a 50% success rate of making it through a cutscene where any of my party doesn't just clip through and ruin the whole experience. Gameplay and everything else is great, but if I have to watch a movie, it should be complete. I'll revisit the game after a few updates and patches. Fantastic game otherwise, play it if you think there's a smidge of hope you'll enjoy it cause you will.",0.04
"The game has some really wonderful aspects, but before buying really watch some streams to see if the turn based Xcom style combat is for you.  I think the thing that really brings the game down is the world navigation is flat out terrible. It's so hard to navigate that it makes an already slow type of genre feel even slower when you have to deal with all the navigation issues. That's not a patchable thing either and it's like other Larian games. I think it's worth playing if you have hundreds of hours to explore the good stuff and overlook the janky aspects of the game. The character performances and models are top notch. I've found myself at times loving it and then I just face palm when a game in 2023 doesn't have a smart save feature. Punishing players for forgetting to hit F5 before combat says volumes about the types of stuff you have to look past.",0.07

"Baldur's Gate 3 is one of those games that manages to get close to the great CRPGs of yesteryear like Arcanum, Dragon Age: Origins and obviously Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. Its story is interesting, its graphics are pretty good, it's playable in co-op and it's narratively faithful enough to its predecessors to think it deserves every hour of gameplay. It could definitely be my GOTY this year.",0.1
"I've been waiting for her for 2 years, and I registered here to tell everyone. It is a masterpiece",0.1
"Loving the game so far, I played during Early Access as well and they have made a lot of improvements. I highly recommend it. The only nit picks I can say are there are a few visual bugs from time to time, but have not had anything large or anything that affected gameplay. I'm talking very minor, like your character is angled a little wrong in a cutscenes so they clip through a pod they're supposed to be in for the 2 seconds before the pod opens. Gameplay is fun and polished, if you like D&amp;D you should give this game a shot.",0.09

"After two great Divinity Original Sin games, Larian put all that it learnt in practice, added great cinematic elements on top of it and filled it with TONS of content. This is possibly my game of the year and one of the best RPGs to ever have been released. Also: no monetization, no FOMO, just you and your game. Enjoy, pals.",0.1

"Best RPG of the decade. Divinity 2 Original Sin was stunningly good. This game sometimes look like “Divinity 3” - there are more mechanics, better graphics etc. Larian deserves all the best: it’s 2023, and they release “hand-crafted” single-player RPG without microtransactions, battlepasses and all that **** and the game does not look like unfinished piece of garbage. Graphics, performance, sound design, combat, plot - 10/10. Another thanks to Larian for Ukrainian localization.",0.1

The ways you can approach every encounter is just insane! I cannot praise this game enough. Please try it for yourself! The voice acting, dialogue choices, and real role playing are perfect. This is a 100 hour game you will want to replay over and over to try different classes, races, and choices. Larian just proved, again, they are the best game developers going right now... by far.. just WOW. I cannot put into words how good this game is.",0.1
This is an absolute masterpiece. One of the best (if not *the* best) RPG's in a decade. This is truly a one of a kind gem that absolutely has to be experienced.,0.1
"I’m really trying to like this game but the turn based combat is just so clunky the gameplay experience is not enjoyable. Also with the overwhelming amount of choices I keep wanting to know what would happen if I pick the other choices and end up reloading save files a lot, so it’s taking me forever to make any progress in the game. Idk I guess I’ll keep trying to progress. Hoping the combat will click at some point.",0.05
I love this game so much. Besides minor bugs and technical issues here and there it far and exceeded all my expectations.,0.1
"This game is an easy 10 as far as user scores go. You have so much freedom in regards to how you want to play and how you want to interact with the world. The combat is my favorite kind of combat for RPGs, which is tactical and turn-based. If you're playing with friends and are next to each other on the turn order, you can move at the same time, which has led to some fun shenanigans. The writing is amazing, the dialogue is great, the characters are cool. I dig it.",0.1

"Best RPG released in decades. The early access was great on it's own, and the full launch has surpassed my already high hopes. Both the RPG and combat elements are amazing for an RPG in this era, and the devs are already hard at work fixing release bugs. Monks are a little wonky, probably because they weren't in early access and had no player feedback, but hopefully they'll address some of the issues and general feedback on them in the next month or two.",0.1
best RPG game ever! I am suprised that this kind of game would be so great.,0.1
"This is best RPG game EVER! Just try to play it and take best expirience! Thx, Swen and your best Team! Make more games to show another developers how they must make games! Optimisation also fantastic! I can't choose 15/10, change for this game Metacritic!",0.1

"This Game is truly magical. I had already spent 100 hours in early access and I was worried that I would get bored by the time I reached the new content. However, that was far from the truth. This is the best rpg I have played in a long time. It brings Dragon Age Origins, the old Baldur Gates game, and Divinity Original Sin 2 in a beautiful hug. Can't wait to play this game over and over again! You can also feel the love that Larian has put into this game and the result is just beautiful.",0.1
The best D&amp;D game out there and it's not even close. You can literally do anything you would've been able to do in an actual tabletop D&amp;D setup. A true masterpiece.,0.1
U guys wanna know what RPG is? Play this game. Then you can compare it to other shells with RPG in a title.,0.1

"Sou um enorme fã de RPG e honestamente esse é o melhor RPG que eu já joguei na vida, o fato dele emular d&amp;d de forma tão perfeita chega a me emocionar e me dar uma nostalgia braba, pra melhorar eles melhoraram muito os sistemas de algumas coisas que não funcionavam no tabletop, tá gostoso demais jogar esse jogo e acredito que vá seguir assim  sempre, recomendo mt",0.1
"A true DnD game through and through, been playing since early access back in 2021 and back then it was already amazing",0.1
"Greatest game ever made. Period. From the spectacular graphics, to the nerve-wracking choices, to the top-tier turn-based combat, to the immensely deep story and characters, Baldur's Gate 3 is a game you don't want to miss out on. Gather your party and venture forth. Now!",0.1
"So far I can say the best RPG of decade. I love DoS2 but Larian did it again, they made even better game. I much more prefer BG3 combat system, graphics for cRPG are amazing, story engaging, interesting characters ( ShadowHeart is love). It's rly hard to stop playing. My personal GOAT. I think Larian and maybe Swuare Enix are 2 last studios I still trust. Larian just showed you still can make quality, complete game. Game is made by players for players!",0.1

"Beter than any game I have played in years. It takes the CRPG genre to an entirely new level. There is a reason the rest of the industry fears this game and has been calling it an ""aberration"" and telling customers not to expect anything as good as this ever lol.",0.1

This game is awesome literally i lost my mind. My first crpg game and i loved that,0.1
"Just an overall amazing, unique and so detailed experience! I've always wanted an experience that feels  like playing tabletop DnD with the benefits of a videogame and I believe Larian and Baldur's Gate 3 delivered in the most awesome way possible! It surely sets new standards and new paths for future RPGs! The atmosphere, the locations, the music, the story, the characters and interactions are all incredible!",0.1
BG3 is pure enjoyment for me. Larian is hitting 1000 with their CRPGs. This game is all I have been able to think about today at work and I can't wait to have the weekend to really lose myself in it.,0.1
"As far as CRPGs go, this is the best from the best devs. A true adaptation of DND with great performance.",0.1

Uma verdadeira obra de arte. Criado com carinho nos mínimos detalhes. Tendo um universo de escolhas e todas elas com um peso particular.,0.1

"We are facing the best rpg of the decade, it has so many options that at first it seems that it can overwhelm but they managed to do it so well that at no time did I feel confused with its mechanics",0.1
"A spellbinding and enchanting entry in to the widely acclaimed Baldur's Gate series. 23 years after BG2, Larian has managed to make a game that built on the original RPG elements, while bringing forth high quality graphics, character depth, an imaginative narrative, and player choice to the forefront. An instant classic that has raised the bar for all past and future cRPG games.",0.1
